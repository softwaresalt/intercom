# Browser Automation

Automates browser workflows using `agent-browser` with concrete navigate→snapshot→interact→re-snapshot recipes, robust authentication handling, and explicit human verification checkpoints for flows that cannot be fully automated.

## Invocation

```
Invoke browser-automation [url:<url>] [auth:none|state|login|token] [mode:verify|interact|form]
```

**Defaults**: `mode:verify`, `auth:none`

**mode:verify** — Navigate to a URL and snapshot the final state for visual confirmation. Read-only.
**mode:interact** — Perform an interaction sequence. Describe the steps in `steps:` (e.g., `steps:"click #submit, wait for .success"`). Without `steps:`, the agent infers interactions from the page context.
**mode:form** — Fill and submit a form. Provide field values in `fields:` (e.g., `fields:"username=alice,email=alice@example.com"`). Without `fields:`, the agent fills fields from context or asks once before proceeding.

## Subagent Depth Constraint

This is a leaf executor. No subagent spawning. Maximum depth: 0.

## Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent-browser` | Browser CLI tool to invoke (default: `agent-browser`) |
| `--headless` | Headless flag passed to the browser CLI (default: `--headless`) |
| `docs/closure` | Directory for closure artifacts; output records are written under `docs/closure/browser-automation/` |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Environment Check

**Skip condition**: Never skip.

1. Verify `agent-browser` is available on PATH. If not found, halt with instructions to install the configured browser CLI.
2. Confirm the target URL (or local server address) is reachable. If not reachable, record the failure and halt — do not attempt a blind automation run.
3. Record the browser CLI version and headless mode for the verification log.

### Phase 2: Authentication Setup

**Skip condition**: Skip unconditionally when `auth:none`. The presence of a cached state file does not override an explicit `auth:none`.

Select the authentication strategy based on the `auth` argument:

**auth:state** (session import):
1. Locate the session state file (typically `.auth/state.json` or a workspace-configured path).
2. Pass the state file to `agent-browser` using its session-import flag.
3. After launch, snapshot the authenticated landing page to confirm the session is valid.
4. If the snapshot shows a login page instead of the authenticated state, fall through to `auth:login`.

**auth:login** (explicit credential login):
1. Navigate to the login URL.
2. Locate the username and password fields using stable selectors (ID, name, or aria-label — not positional).
3. Fill credentials from environment variables (`BROWSER_USERNAME`, `BROWSER_PASSWORD`). Never hardcode credentials.
4. Submit the form and wait for the post-login redirect to settle.
5. Snapshot the authenticated state. If login fails (login page still visible, error message present), halt and report the failure with the snapshot as evidence.

**auth:token** (header/cookie injection):
1. Configure `agent-browser` to inject the authorization token as a request header or cookie (from env var `BROWSER_AUTH_TOKEN`).
2. Navigate to a protected URL and confirm the authenticated response with a snapshot.

**Human checkpoint — OAuth / SSO / payment flows**:
If the login flow involves an OAuth provider, SSO redirect, or payment processor:
- Halt automation at the redirect.
- Present the current URL and a snapshot to the operator.
- Wait for the operator to complete the external flow and confirm.
- Resume automation from the post-auth landing page.

### Phase 3: Navigate and Snapshot

**Skip condition**: Never skip.

1. Navigate to the target URL using `agent-browser --headless`.
2. Wait for the page to reach a stable state: no pending network requests, no layout shifts. Use a fixed wait only as a last resort.
3. Take a snapshot (screenshot + DOM accessibility tree when supported by the CLI).
4. Record the URL, page title, HTTP status (if available), and snapshot path.
5. Identify interactive elements relevant to the current mode (buttons, links, form fields).

### Phase 4: Interact

**Skip condition**: Skip when `mode:verify` (snapshot only).

Execute the interaction sequence:

**mode:interact** (general interaction):
1. For each step in the sequence: identify the target element by stable selector, perform the action (click, hover, keyboard input), wait for the resulting state change to settle.
2. Take a snapshot after each step that changes visible state.
3. Record the element selector, action taken, and resulting URL or DOM change.

**mode:form** (form automation):
1. Enumerate all input fields in the form using the accessibility tree or DOM query.
2. Fill each field: text inputs from the provided data map, selects by value, checkboxes by boolean state.
3. Before submission: take a pre-submit snapshot showing all filled values.
4. Submit the form (click the submit button or trigger form submission via keyboard).
5. Wait for the post-submit state to settle (redirect, confirmation message, or validation error).
6. Take a post-submit snapshot.
7. Record the success or failure indicator, the final URL, and any visible confirmation or error text.

**Human checkpoint — external redirects during interaction**:
If any step redirects to an external domain (payment gateway, identity provider, external OAuth):
- Halt the interaction.
- Capture the current state (URL + snapshot).
- Present the checkpoint to the operator with clear instructions.
- Resume only after explicit operator confirmation.

### Phase 5: Session Management

**Skip condition**: Skip when no session export is required.

1. If session state should be preserved for subsequent runs, export the current browser session to the state file path used in Phase 2.
2. Record the export path and timestamp.
3. Do not commit session state files to source control. Confirm `.gitignore` covers the state file path.

### Phase 6: Visual Verification

**Skip condition**: Skip when `mode:interact` without an explicit visual target.

Compare the final snapshot against a reference image or a set of expected DOM assertions:

* If a reference image exists: diff pixel regions of interest. Report the diff percentage. Flag regions that differ beyond a configurable threshold.
* If DOM assertions are provided: verify that expected elements are present (by selector or text content), that absent elements are gone, and that visible text matches expectations.
* Record: pass / partial-pass (within threshold) / fail, with snapshot paths as evidence.

### Phase 7: Output

Produce a verification record with:

1. **Summary** — URL, mode, auth strategy, final verdict (pass / partial-pass / fail / blocked-at-checkpoint)
2. **Phase log** — each phase that ran, skip reasons for those skipped
3. **Snapshots** — paths to all captured screenshots with captions
4. **Human checkpoints** — each checkpoint encountered, operator action recorded, outcome
5. **Failures** — each failure with the selector or element, action attempted, error received, and snapshot at time of failure

Do not persist snapshots to source control. Write them to `docs/closure/browser-automation/` or a workspace-configured temp directory.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)**. Use Tier 3 only for complex multi-step flows requiring judgment about element identification or failure diagnosis.
