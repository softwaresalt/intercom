description: "Validate affected runtime surfaces after build and CI using adapter-based runtime validators and structured evidence"
---

## Runtime Verification

Validate that the change works in the runtime surfaces it actually affects. Green tests are necessary; they are not always sufficient.

## When to Use

Invoke after CI is green, before merge, after merge, or after deployment whenever the work changes a runtime surface or rollout-sensitive behavior:

* CLI behavior
* Public APIs
* Browser-visible UI flows
* Background jobs or scheduled tasks
* Deployments, migrations, or feature-flagged release paths

## Inputs

* `surface`: (Required) One of `cli`, `api`, `browser`, `background-job`, or `auto`.
* `target`: (Optional) Path, URL, command, or subsystem to verify.
* `mode`: (Optional, default `auto`) Operator-facing execution mode. One of `manual`, `api`, `browser`, or `auto`.
* `adapter`: (Optional) Explicit validator adapter override. One of `command`, `http`, `browser`, `job`, or `manual`.
* `context`: (Optional) PR, task, branch, or feature context.
* `validator_manifest`: (Optional) Structured contract from `runtime_validation.validator_manifest` describing surface adapters, probe hints, and manual checkpoints.
* `validation_expectations`: (Optional) Structured expectations from `runtime_validation.validation_expectations` describing required surfaces, minimum verdict, invariants, and explicit release blockers.

## Output

* Verification report at `docs/closure/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-runtime-verification.md`
* Structured validator evidence containing surface adapter selection, probe outcomes, manual checkpoint evidence, blocked prerequisites, follow-up risks, and recommended next action
* `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_FOLLOW_UP`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED` verdict (render `PASS WITH FOLLOW-UP` in prose when helpful)

## Required Protocol

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-intercom.instructions.md`: broadcast which runtime surface is being
verified, keep the operator informed of pass / follow-up / fail outcomes, and use the intercom
clarification or standby flow when manual operator confirmation is part of the verification path.

When the `browser-verification` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/browser-verification.instructions.md`: verify server
availability first, choose headed vs headless mode intentionally, derive routes
from changed surfaces, and call out explicit human checkpoints for external
flows.

When the `strict-safety` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/strict-safety.instructions.md`: when verification exists
to prove or contain a risky action, keep the relevant `ProposedAction`,
`ActionRisk`, and current `ActionResult` visible in the verification record
rather than treating them as hidden implementation detail.

When the `release-observability` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/release-observability.instructions.md`: reference the
monitoring plan and rollback triggers during verification so the verification
report can confirm whether monitoring is active and rollback paths are ready.

### Step 1: Load the Validator Contract

Resolve the structured runtime-validation contract from explicit inputs or
`.autoharness/workspace-profile.yaml`:

* `runtime_validation.validator_manifest` — source of truth for surface adapters,
  probe hints, and manual checkpoints
* `runtime_validation.validation_expectations` — expected surfaces, minimum
  verdict, invariants, and explicit release blockers

Choose the lowest-cost adapter that still gives confidence:

* **CLI / command adapter** → run representative commands, inspect output, validate exit codes
* **API / HTTP adapter** → hit representative endpoints, confirm response shape/status, inspect logs if available
* **Browser adapter** → verify user-visible flows, rendering, navigation, and critical interactions
* **Background-job adapter** → confirm trigger path, observable side effects, and logs or queue state

If `adapter` is provided, validate that it is compatible with the selected
surface and document why it overrides the default choice. If `mode` is provided,
treat it as the execution style (`browser`, `api`, `manual`) and derive the
concrete adapter from `validator_manifest.surfaces[].adapter_hint`:

* `mode=api` usually maps to the `http` adapter
* `mode=browser` maps to the `browser` adapter
* `mode=manual` maps to the `manual` adapter
* `mode=auto` defers to the manifest's adapter hint or the inferred surface

If `surface=auto`, infer the surface from the changed files and PR context, then
confirm the selected surface appears in `validator_manifest.surfaces[]` before
continuing. Record the main invariants that must still hold after the change.

### Step 2: Run Environment Prechecks

Before exercising the runtime surface, verify:

* the build or deployable artifact under test is the expected one
* the target environment, service, or dev server is reachable
* required ports, URLs, fixtures, credentials, and seed data are available
* browser tooling exists when browser mode is requested
* human verification dependencies (OAuth, email inbox access, SMS, payment sandbox, native dialogs) are known up front

If the environment cannot support meaningful verification, return **BLOCKED**
with the exact missing prerequisite instead of pretending the surface was tested.

### Step 3: Select Adapter and Execution Mode

* Use **browser** mode only when browser tooling is available or the workspace enabled the `browser-verification` capability pack
* Use **api** mode when HTTP or RPC verification is sufficient
* Use **manual** mode when the runtime surface cannot be exercised automatically in the current environment
* Prefer the adapter hinted by `validator_manifest.surfaces[].adapter_hint` unless the current environment forces a safer downgrade

When browser mode is selected:

* prefer **headless** for deterministic smoke coverage
* prefer **headed** for visual regressions, step-through debugging, or flows that
  require human handoff
* treat OAuth, payments, email, SMS, CAPTCHAs, native dialogs, and other
  operator-dependent flows as explicit human verification stop points

### Step 4: Select Targets and Scenarios

Choose scenarios from the changed surface, not from convenience alone:

* use the explicit `target` when provided
* otherwise infer the most relevant commands, endpoints, routes, jobs, or pages
  from changed files, router mappings, API handlers, and PR context
* for browser work, prioritize routes tied to changed components plus one adjacent
  critical path that could regress as a side effect

### Step 5: Execute Verification

Record:

* What was verified
* Which validator adapter ran for each surface
* Any relevant risky action and current `ActionResult` when the verification is tied to a high-risk, destructive, migration, or rollback-sensitive step
* The exact commands, URLs, routes, jobs, or scenarios used
* Expected behavior
* Observed behavior
* Validator evidence collected (logs, responses, screenshots, traces, stdout, exit codes, or notes)

For browser-backed verification:

* confirm the server is available before launching the browser
* record whether verification ran headed or headless
* pause at declared human stop points and capture manual checkpoint evidence describing what the operator must confirm, what actually happened, and whether the checkpoint blocks release

### Step 6: Decide Verification Status

Return one of:

* **PASS** / `PASS` — the runtime surface behaved as expected
* **PASS WITH FOLLOW-UP** / `PASS_WITH_FOLLOW_UP` — usable but additional monitoring or cleanup is required
* **FAIL** / `FAIL` — the runtime surface did not behave as expected
* **BLOCKED** / `BLOCKED` — meaningful verification could not proceed because a required environment dependency was missing

### Step 7: Feed Operational Closure

Hand the following to `operational-closure` as structured validator evidence:

* **Verification verdict**: PASS, PASS WITH FOLLOW-UP, FAIL, or BLOCKED
* **Runtime surfaces verified**: which surfaces were exercised, which adapters were used, and how those choices mapped to `runtime_validation.validator_manifest`
* **Evidence collected**: commands, URLs, responses, logs, screenshots, traces, or notes
* **Manual checkpoint evidence**: explicit outcomes for any operator-assisted or external flow stop points
* **BLOCKED prerequisites**: if BLOCKED, the exact missing dependency or environment gap
* **Risky action state**: any `ProposedAction` entries and their current `ActionResult` when verification is tied to a high-risk or rollback-sensitive path
* **Follow-up recommendations**: monitoring, cleanup, or additional verification needed
* **Releasability handoff**: which monitoring, rollback, owner, or validation-window requirements from `runtime_validation.releasability` remain to be satisfied during closure

The ship agent MUST invoke operational-closure even when verification is BLOCKED —
a BLOCKED verdict is not equivalent to PASS and must be recorded as a closure
condition.

## Quality Criteria

* Verification targets the runtime surface actually changed by the work
* Environment prechecks are recorded, not implied
* Evidence is specific enough that another operator could reproduce it
* Validator evidence and manual checkpoint evidence stay structured rather than collapsing into report-oriented runtime notes
* Browser verification chooses headed vs headless intentionally rather than by habit
* Route or scenario selection is traceable to the changed surface
* Human verification stop points are explicit when automation cannot complete the flow
* Risky actions remain legible when verification is proving a high-risk or rollback-sensitive path
* Follow-up risks are explicit, not implied


## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — runtime surface validation follows defined protocol.
