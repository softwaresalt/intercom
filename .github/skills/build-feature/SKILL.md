description: "Execute a harness loop — iteratively run tests, capture failures, fix code, and repeat until the harness passes or the circuit breaker trips"
---

## Build Feature

Implement a requested feature by continuously looping against a strict, compiling, but failing test harness until all tests pass.

## When to Use

Invoked by the ship agent when a task has the `harness-ready` label. Not invoked directly by users.

## Inputs

* `task_id`: (Required) The backlog task ID to implement.
* `harness_cmd`: (Required) The test command to run (e.g., `go test ./...`).

## Output

* All harness tests passing
* Code changes committed
* Task marked complete in backlog

## Required Protocol

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-intercom.instructions.md` throughout the loop: establish heartbeat /
ping visibility up front, broadcast meaningful attempt transitions, and route any destructive
actions through the intercom approval path rather than improvising local-only approval.

When the `agent-engram` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-engram.instructions.md` throughout the loop: prefer indexed symbol and
impact lookup while diagnosing failures, verify the workspace is bound before trusting engram
results, and refresh stale indexes before concluding the code graph is wrong.

### The Harness Loop (5-Attempt Circuit Breaker)

**Before entering the loop**: Read coding standards once — constitution Principle I
and `go.instructions.md`. These apply to all fix attempts.
Do not re-read the full standards on every iteration; only do a targeted re-read
if working on a file in an unfamiliar module or if the error pattern changes.

This loop is a skill-managed exception to the universal 3-retry circuit breaker
(per `circuit-breaker.instructions.md`). The 5-attempt limit governs within this
loop scope. However, if the same error reaches its third counted failure for the
same operation, the universal circuit breaker applies: stop and escalate.
Unrelated loop iterations do not advance that per-operation counter.
Track same-operation counters across the entire loop. A recurrence can match
any prior attempt in that operation's failure chain, not only the immediately
previous iteration. Distinct errors advance distinct per-operation counters.

```text
Attempt 1..5:
  1. Run harness_cmd → capture stdout/stderr
  2. If all tests pass → SUCCESS → exit loop
  3. Parse failure output → identify failing tests and error messages
  4. Match the failure against all prior same-operation chains → increment that operation's counter on recurrence; otherwise record a distinct per-operation counter
  5. Fix the code to address the specific failure
  6. Verify compilation: go vet ./...
  7. If compilation fails → fix compilation errors first
  8. Loop back to step 1

After 5 failures → mark task as BLOCKED → exit
```

### Step-by-Step Detail

#### Step 1: Run the Harness

Execute `harness_cmd` and capture the full output. Record execution time.

**Stall timeouts**:

* Build/test commands: 45 minutes
* Other commands: 5 minutes

If the command exceeds the timeout, terminate and count it as a failed attempt.

#### Step 2: Evaluate Results

If all tests pass, proceed to quality gates.

#### Step 3: Parse Failures

Extract from the test output:

* Which tests failed
* The assertion or error message
* The file and line where the failure occurred
* The expected vs. actual values (if applicable)

When the `agent-engram` capability pack is installed, use engram-first lookup to inspect symbols,
callers, and affected regions before expanding into broader file-based searches.

#### Step 4: Re-read Standards

Before writing any fix, re-read the relevant coding standards:

* Constitution Principle I (safety-first language practices)
* Technology-specific instructions (`go.instructions.md`)
* Any instruction files matching the files being modified

#### Step 5: Fix the Code

Apply targeted fixes to address the specific test failure. Do NOT:

* Modify the test to make it pass (tests are the specification)
* Add unrelated changes
* Refactor code not related to the failure
* Skip error handling to shortcut a fix

If the root cause is still unclear after repeated attempts, or the task touches a risky subsystem, invoke **safety-modes** in `investigate-first` or `freeze-scope` mode before continuing.

#### Step 6: Verify Compilation

Run `go vet ./...` to confirm the fix compiles. If compilation fails, fix compilation errors before returning to the harness loop.

### Post-Loop Quality Gates

After the harness passes:

1. **Lint**: `go vet ./...`
2. **Format**: ``
   * If violations found: `gofmt -w .` and re-check
3. **Full test suite**: `go test ./...`

### Commit

If all quality gates pass:

1. Stage all changes
2. Create a conventional commit message referencing the task ID
3. Report success to the caller

## Behavioral Constraints

* No subagent spawning (leaf executor)
* Never modify test files (tests are the specification)
* Maximum 5 attempts before circuit breaker trips (skill-managed exception; see `circuit-breaker.instructions.md`)
* The third counted failure of the same operation and error triggers the
  universal circuit breaker.
* Same-operation counters persist across all prior loop attempts; distinct
  errors advance distinct per-operation counters
* Read coding standards once at task start; targeted re-read for unfamiliar modules
* One file change per tool call; broadcast after each write
* When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, use intercom broadcasts for attempt milestones and file-write visibility

## Quality Criteria

* All harness tests pass
* No lint violations
* No format violations
* Full test suite passes
* Changes are scoped to the task requirements

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — routine build loop execution and quality verification.
