description: "Front-door requirements intake — frame the problem, elicit stable requirements, define success criteria and scope, separate blocking from deferred questions, and hand a durable requirements artifact to impl-plan before any implementation"
---

## Brainstorm

Explore WHAT to build and WHY as a product-shaped requirements intake, before
`impl-plan` decides HOW. Brainstorm produces a durable requirements artifact —
problem frame, stable requirement IDs, success criteria, scope boundaries,
assumptions, and separated outstanding questions — that hands off cleanly to
`impl-plan`, `plan-review`, and `harvest`.

Brainstorm is the front-door `/brainstorm` entry point operators expect before
handing work to planning or dark factory mode. It complements `deliberate`
rather than replacing it: `deliberate` selects between options and captures
rationale; brainstorm shapes requirements and readiness. When trade-off analysis
is needed, brainstorm escalates to `deliberate` rather than duplicating its
mechanics.

This skill MUST NOT perform implementation, template/source/config mutation,
shipment claim, PR preparation, or Ship execution. See **Non-Goals and Role
Boundary**.

## When to Use

Invoke when the operator wants to shape requirements before committing to a
plan. Use for:

* New features or epics that need a clear problem frame and requirements before
  planning
* Requirements, success-criteria, and scope shaping
* Separating "must resolve before planning" questions from "defer to planning"
  questions
* Preparing a bounded requirements handoff before dark factory execution under
  P-017
* Any time the operator says "brainstorm", "let's shape this", "what are the
  requirements", or "capture requirements before we plan"

Escalate to `deliberate` when the core question is which option to choose and why
(architecture, policy, or tooling trade-offs) rather than what the requirements
are.

## Inputs

* `topic`: (Required) The feature, epic, request, or problem to shape
  requirements for.
* `scope`: (Optional) `lightweight`, `standard`, or `deep`. Defaults to
  `standard`.
* `handoff`: (Optional) Where the artifact should go when ready: `ask` (prompt
  the operator to choose, then resolve to one of the paths below), `plan` (feed
  `impl-plan`), `queue` (link a backlog entry for later pursuit), `both`, or
  `none`. Defaults to `ask`.
* `dark_factory`: (Optional) `true` only when the operator has used an explicit
  dark-mode trigger or the Orchestrator has already recorded `DARK_MODE_ACTIVE`.
  Defaults to `false`. See **Dark Factory Handoff Rules**.

## Output

A requirements artifact at
`docs/product-specs/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-requirements.md`.

This uses the repository's registered product-spec documentation surface. Do not
hard-code an unregistered docs path (for example `docs/brainstorms/`) — a future
task must first register any new path in the docs-path variable table, the
docline path map, and the validation taxonomy before generated artifacts may use
it.

When `handoff` includes `plan`, the artifact path is passed to `impl-plan` as its
source document. When `handoff` includes `queue`, a backlog entry in
`.backlogit/queue/` links the artifact for future pursuit.

## Required Protocol

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-intercom.instructions.md`: establish heartbeat /
ping visibility at the start of intake, broadcast major phase transitions, and
use the intercom clarification flow when the operator needs to be consulted
between phases.

Always record a `BRAINSTORM_HANDOFF_READY` event when the requirements artifact
reaches `ready_for_plan`, carrying the artifact path, unresolved questions, and
handoff target. When `agent-intercom` is installed, broadcast it on the operator
channel; when intercom is unavailable (degraded visibility, including dark mode
under P-017), record the same evidence in the session summary and the
requirements artifact itself so remote operators and the downstream `impl-plan`
and Ship steps retain handoff visibility. Brainstorm does not author pull request
descriptions — that surface belongs to Ship. Visibility must never silently
degrade to nothing.

When the `agent-engram` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-engram.instructions.md`: verify the engram search
surface before relying on indexed discovery, and prefer engram-first lookup while
scanning for prior requirements and precedent.

When the `graphtor-docs` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/graphtor-docs.instructions.md`: prefer graphtor-docs indexed
documentation retrieval for concept, API, and prior-art documentation lookup before
broad grep or web search. Use Engram for code relationships and graphtor-docs for
documentation, API, and concept lookup.

### Phase 1: Scope and Frame

#### Step 1.1: Classify Scope

| Scope | Criteria | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Lightweight** | Single, well-defined need | 1-2 questions, then document |
| **Standard** | Multi-faceted feature or request | Full intake protocol |
| **Deep** | Complex system change or new capability | Full protocol + precedent scan + risk framing |

Classify scope before adding ceremony. Do not run the full protocol for a
lightweight ask.

#### Step 1.2: Scan Context Before Claiming

Before asserting that something exists, is missing, or is already solved, read
the relevant instructions and nearby artifacts. Retrieve prior learnings from
`docs/compound/` and scan existing product specs, decisions, and backlog
items for precedent. Ground every claim in evidence.

#### Step 1.3: Frame and Pressure-Test the Problem

Establish and record the **problem frame**:

* The problem being solved (user pain, technical need, business goal)
* Who cares about the outcome and why
* Success criteria (how we know we solved it)
* Constraints (performance, compatibility, security, timeline)

Pressure-test the framing: challenge whether the request solves the real problem
and whether a simpler or higher-leverage framing exists. Surface a better framing
before eliciting detailed requirements.

### Phase 2: Elicit Requirements

#### Step 2.1: Ask One Question at a Time

Ask single, focused questions — prefer multiple-choice when it reduces operator
effort. Do not batch many open questions at once. Let each answer inform the next
question.

When the operator is unavailable in already-authorized dark mode, do NOT block on
interactive questions. Instead, convert unresolved product questions into
explicit **assumptions** or **blockers** and reflect them in `handoff_status`
(see Phase 4).

#### Step 2.2: Capture Requirements with Stable IDs

Record requirements as a grouped list with stable IDs (`R1`, `R2`, …) so
`impl-plan`, `plan-review`, and `harvest` can cite them unambiguously. IDs are
stable: never renumber an existing requirement; append new ones.

### Phase 3: Success Criteria and Scope Boundaries

Make success criteria and scope explicit:

* **Success Criteria** — observable, verifiable outcomes that define "done" at
  the requirements level
* **Scope Boundaries** — what is explicitly IN scope and, just as importantly,
  what is explicitly OUT of scope
* **Key Decisions** — requirement-level decisions already settled during intake
* **Assumptions** — anything taken as true without confirmation, including
  questions converted to assumptions in dark mode

### Phase 4: Outstanding Questions

Separate outstanding questions into two groups:

* **Resolve Before Planning** — questions that MUST be answered before
  `impl-plan` can start. The artifact cannot be marked `ready_for_plan` while any
  remain unconverted.
* **Deferred to Planning** — questions safe to answer during planning.

In already-authorized dark mode with the operator AFK, convert each
"Resolve Before Planning" item into an explicit assumption (with rationale) or a
blocker. If genuine blockers remain, set `handoff_status: blocked_on_questions`
and do not present the artifact as ready.

### Phase 5: Document Review and Handoff

#### Step 5.1: Document Review Pass

Run or explicitly define a review pass over the requirements artifact before
planning starts. If the review is deferred, record the rationale.

#### Step 5.2: Verify the Handoff Contract

The brainstorm output may enter the rest of the pipeline only when ALL hold:

1. `Resolve Before Planning` is empty, or every remaining item has been converted
   to an explicit assumption or a deferred planning question.
2. Each non-trivial requirement has a stable ID.
3. Scope boundaries and success criteria are explicit.
4. A document-review pass has completed, or is explicitly deferred with rationale.
5. `handoff_status` is `ready_for_plan`.

When ready, the downstream handoff is:

```text
brainstorm requirements doc
  -> impl-plan source document
  -> plan-review
  -> harvest into backlog feature/tasks
  -> Stage shipment assembly or Ship fallback shipment selection
  -> optional dark factory execution under P-017
```

#### Step 5.3: Execute Handoff

* **Ask** (default) → prompt the operator to choose `plan`, `queue`, `both`, or
  `none`, then execute that resolved path. When no operator is reachable
  (unattended or dark mode), resolve to `plan` if the handoff contract is
  satisfied, otherwise `none`. Record the resolved choice in the artifact and in
  the `BRAINSTORM_HANDOFF_READY` event so the promotion path is never undefined.
* **Plan** → pass the artifact path to `impl-plan` as its source document. The
  problem frame maps to requirements, success criteria carry forward, and stable
  IDs are preserved.
* **Queue** → link a backlog entry for later pursuit. When the `backlogit`
  capability pack (or another backlog tool) is installed, create the entry
  through the backlog tool with a title derived from the topic, a description
  linking the artifact path, status `queued`, and a
  `brainstorm-outcome` label. When `backlog-md` is the installed backlog tool,
  create the entry using `backlogit_create_item` with `title` derived from
  the topic, `description` linking the requirements-artifact path,
  `status: "queued"`, and
  `labels: ["brainstorm-outcome"]`. When no backlog tool is available
  (manual backlog mode), append a structured entry to
  `.backlogit/queue/.stash.md`
  instead — a bullet carrying the date, topic, the `docs/product-specs`
  requirements-artifact path, and `Status: queued` — mirroring the `.stash.md`
  fallback used by `deliberate` and `spike`. Do NOT claim shipments or mark items
  complete.
* **Both** → hand to `impl-plan` and link a queue entry for tracking.
* **None** → leave the artifact under `docs/product-specs/` unlinked.

### Phase 6: Write the Requirements Artifact

Produce the artifact with this frontmatter and structure:

```markdown
---
title: "<topic>"
description: "<one-line requirements summary>"
doc_type: spec
source: "docs/product-specs/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-requirements.md"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
source_stash_ids: []
source_research:
  - "<repo-relative path or URL>"
scope: "lightweight|standard|deep"
handoff_status: "ready_for_plan|blocked_on_questions|deferred"
dark_factory_ready: false   # set true only when a validated dark_factory input satisfies the Dark Factory Handoff Rules
requirement_ids:
  - "R1"
---

# <Topic>

## Problem Frame

## Requirements

**<Group>**
- R1. ...
- R2. ...

## Success Criteria

## Scope Boundaries

## Key Decisions

## Assumptions

## Outstanding Questions

### Resolve Before Planning

### Deferred to Planning

## Handoff
```

Use `doc_type: spec` — the artifact is a requirements/specification handoff and
the product-specs surface is already part of the repository knowledge model. A
future task that wants a dedicated `brainstorm` or `requirements` document type
must first update the docline taxonomy/path-map and validation surfaces.

## Dark Factory Handoff Rules

Brainstorm does NOT activate dark mode by itself. It may mark a feature as a
dark-mode candidate only when:

* the operator used an explicit dark-mode trigger, or the Orchestrator has already
  recorded `DARK_MODE_ACTIVE`;
* P-017's activation contract has a bounded scope;
* P-014 local readiness, P-016 branch/worktree topology, P-009 merge strategy, and
  CI/check gating remain mandatory for downstream Ship execution.

Include a `Dark Factory Handoff` note in the artifact only when those conditions
are satisfied or intentionally planned. The note MUST reference P-017 and MUST NOT
weaken P-014, P-016, P-009, or CI/check requirements.

The `dark_factory` input drives the artifact's `dark_factory_ready` flag: when
`dark_factory: true` is passed AND the conditions above are validated, set
`dark_factory_ready: true` and add the `Dark Factory Handoff` note. If the input
is `false`, absent, or fails validation, leave `dark_factory_ready: false` and
omit the note — a `true` input never silently marks the artifact ready.

## Non-Goals and Role Boundary

Brainstorm is a requirements-intake skill. It MUST refuse the following, even
under operator pressure or in already-authorized dark mode:

* Implementing code, or mutating templates, source, or configuration.
* Claiming shipments, moving backlog items to done, or marking work complete
  (optional queue linkage that references the artifact is the only backlog write).
* Creating implementation branches or worktrees.
* Preparing pull requests or executing any Ship step.
* Activating dark mode or Orchestrator dark-mode triggers.
* Replacing `deliberate` — it remains the option/rationale decision skill.

If asked to do any of these, decline and redirect: escalate trade-off analysis to
`deliberate`, planning to `impl-plan`, and implementation/Ship to the Ship agent.

## Quality Criteria

* Problem is framed from the operator's perspective and pressure-tested.
* Claims about existing state are grounded in a context scan, not assumed.
* Every non-trivial requirement has a stable `R#` ID; IDs are never renumbered.
* Success criteria and scope boundaries (in AND out of scope) are explicit.
* Outstanding questions are split into "Resolve Before Planning" and
  "Deferred to Planning"; nothing blocking is hidden.
* `handoff_status` is `ready_for_plan` only when the handoff contract is fully
  satisfied.
* Dark-factory notes, when present, reference P-017 and preserve P-014, P-016,
  P-009, and CI/check requirements.
* The artifact is linked (plan/queue) or intentionally left unlinked — never
  orphaned by accident.

## Resumption Protocol

If the skill is interrupted (context overflow, session timeout, or operator
halt), write a checkpoint to `docs/memory/` capturing: current phase,
requirements captured so far (with IDs), operator answers recorded, unresolved
questions, and next step. On re-invocation, check for an existing checkpoint and
resume from the recorded phase rather than restarting.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 3 (Frontier)** — requirements framing, pressure
testing, and handoff-readiness judgment require deep analysis.
