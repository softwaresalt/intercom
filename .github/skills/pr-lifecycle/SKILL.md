# PR Lifecycle Skill

Manage the branch-to-merged workflow for a feature or chore branch. This
skill creates or updates the pull request, responds to review feedback,
keeps CI healthy, and stops at the user merge gate unless the user
explicitly approves the merge.

## Purpose

Use this skill when implementation work is ready to move through pull
request execution. It centralizes the PR control loop so higher-level
agents can treat review, CI follow-up, and merge approval as one bounded
workflow.

## Agent-Intercom Communication

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, call `ping` at
session start. If reachable, broadcast at every step. If unreachable,
warn the operator that visibility is degraded and continue locally.

| Event | Level | Message prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Session start | info | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] Starting: branch={input.branch}` |
| Branch pushed | info | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] Branch pushed: {branch}` |
| PR created | info | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] PR created: {pr_url}` |
| PR updated | info | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] PR updated: {pr_url}` |
| Feedback received | info | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] Review feedback: {comment_count} comments` |
| Fix applied | info | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] Fix applied for: {comment_summary}` |
| CI failure | warning | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] CI failed — delegating to fix-ci` |
| CI green | info | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] CI passing` |
| Ready for merge | success | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] PR ready — awaiting user approval` |
| Merged | success | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] Merged: {pr_url}` |
| Blocked | warning | `[PR-LIFECYCLE] Blocked: {reason}` |

## Inputs

* `${input:branch}`: (Required) Branch name to ship.
* `${input:title}`: (Optional) PR title override. When omitted, derive
  the title from the branch name or prepared PR description.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare the branch

1. Confirm the branch exists locally and is ready to push.
2. Gather or generate the PR title and body before calling GitHub
   tooling.
3. Ensure the PR body contains the `## Local Review Readiness` block required by
   `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` §1.9, including:
   * reviewed HEAD SHA
   * outcome (`READY`, `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS`, or `BLOCKED`)
   * blocking-finding summary
   * successful full local build evidence for code-changing PRs, or explicit non-applicability
     for documentation-only/backlog-only PRs
   * follow-up item IDs or residual-risk notes when applicable
4. Halt instead of creating/updating the PR if the calling agent cannot provide
   a current-HEAD local readiness record.
5. Halt instead of creating/updating the PR if the current-HEAD readiness record
   reports `BLOCKED`.
6. Halt instead of creating/updating the PR if code was added, removed, or changed
   and the readiness evidence lacks a successful full local build command/result.
7. Push the branch if it is not already available on the remote.

### Step 2: Create or update the pull request

1. Use the GitHub CLI (`gh pr create` or `gh pr edit`) to create or
   refresh the pull request.
2. Capture the PR URL, branch, and base branch as the active context.
3. Reuse an existing PR when the branch already has one instead of
   creating duplicates.
4. After PR creation or update, verify the local readiness block is still present
   in the PR body and references the current HEAD SHA.

### Step 2b: Optional shadow review

When the repository is hosted on GitHub, Copilot Review may be requested in
advisory shadow mode immediately after PR creation or after pushing new commits:

1. Request shadow review per `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` §1.1 when the operator or workflow enables migration shadow mode.
2. Poll for completion using the back-off cadence in §1.2.
3. Do not treat shadow review as a required dependency for merge readiness unless the operator explicitly elevates it for the current PR.
4. When `DARK_MODE_ACTIVE` is present, keep shadow review advisory by default:
   local review readiness remains authoritative, and timeout/unavailability is
   recorded in the PR readiness summary instead of blocking merge readiness.

### Step 3: Handle review feedback

1. Monitor PR review comments, especially automated shadow-review comments when requested.
2. For GitHub-hosted repositories, follow the optional shadow-review
   workflow in `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` Part 1:
   categorize comments (§1.3), apply fixes (§1.4), reply to threads
   (§1.5), and resolve bot-authored threads via GraphQL (§1.6). Before applying
   any fix, classify the comment against the **P-021 C1** same-contract-surface
   test (see the operational restatement in
   `.github/instructions/circuit-breaker.instructions.md`'s "Review-Fix Cycle
   Definition" section): only a comment that passes C1 may be fixed directly.
   When `DARK_MODE_ACTIVE` is present and the operator is AFK, continue these
   bounded review-fix-push iterations autonomously: fix in-scope comments, commit and
   push, reply with the fixing commit, resolve bot-authored threads, and only halt
   for unsafe changes, unresolved P0/P1 findings, elevated blocking review, or
   circuit-breaker limits.
3. For non-GitHub repositories, apply bounded fixes directly when they
   are clearly actionable and pass the same P-021 C1 test.
4. Re-run the relevant validation after each fix cycle.
5. Before every code-changing fix push, require successful full local build
   evidence. Documentation-only/backlog-only fixes may record full-build
   non-applicability. Halt on missing or failed build evidence.
6. Keep the PR description and review context aligned with the latest
   branch state.
7. **Out-of-scope disposition (P-021 C2/C3)**: every comment that fails the C1
   test in step 2/3 above MUST follow this required ordered, capture-first
   sequence instead of being fixed — the loop terminates honestly rather than
   by expansion:
   * (a) **Capture per P-021 C2**, performed BEFORE any thread reply/closure
     because C2 makes capture a precondition for closing the finding. Record
     the full six-field payload:
     1. The literal token `DEFERRED SCOPE EXPANSION`.
     2. A one-sentence statement of the expansion.
     3. Why it is out of scope, citing the P-021 C1 test.
     4. Source refs — PR number, review-thread ID, task ID, feature ID,
        shipment ID. On the GitHub-hosted path (step 2) the PR number and the
        review-thread ID BOTH always exist at capture, so no per-field `N/A`
        case arises there. On the non-GitHub path (step 3) there is no
        review-thread mechanism: record the review-thread ID as `N/A` and the
        PR number with its actual value whenever a PR is already open (the
        normal case), never fusing the two refs into a single `PR/thread`
        token or assuming one field's availability from the other's.
     5. A `requires deliberation` flag.
     6. Kind and a PROVISIONAL priority only — re-prioritization and triage
        remain Stage-only (P-021 C5 capture-only carve-out).
   * **Thread-present disposition (GitHub-hosted path, step 2)**: (b) post a
     substantive thread reply explaining the finding, why it is out of scope
     citing the C1 boundary, that no code change was made, and CITING THE
     GENERATED DEFERRED ENTRY ID returned by the (a) capture, per P-021 C3;
     (c) resolve the thread via §1.6, permitted only after the reply citing
     that ID is posted; (d) add a residual-risk record entry in the PR body
     naming the SAME deferred entry ID. Replying to or resolving an
     out-of-scope thread BEFORE the C2 capture exists is PROHIBITED, since the
     reply cannot cite an entry ID that has not been generated yet; a reply
     omitting the deferred entry ID does not satisfy C3.
   * **Threadless discharge (non-GitHub path, step 3)**: no review-thread
     mechanism exists on this path, so the C3 thread-reply/resolve step does
     not apply and its absence is NOT a C3 shortfall. After the (a) capture,
     cite the generated deferred entry ID in the TASK-LEVEL, run-level, and
     closure/PR residual-risk records instead — the complete set the
     reference obligation requires when no thread reply can carry the ID.
   * If a finding captured threadless on the non-GitHub path later surfaces on
     a review thread (e.g. the repository migrates to a GitHub-hosted review
     flow within the same run), the reply cites the ALREADY-CAPTURED deferred
     entry ID; this skill MUST NOT create a second entry, consistent with the
     SINGLE-WRITE CAPTURE INVARIANT and LATE-SURFACING THREAD rule (both
     authored in 134.004-T).

### Step 4: Handle CI failures

1. If CI fails, invoke the `fix-ci` skill with the active PR or branch
   context.
2. For GitHub-hosted repositories, ensure the fix-ci skill follows the
   CI polling protocol in `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` Part 2
   for status monitoring, failure extraction, and fix-push-poll loops.
3. Ensure code-changing CI remediation pushes include successful full local build
   evidence, or documentation-only/backlog-only remediation records explicit
   non-applicability.
4. Let `fix-ci` own the remediation loop for failing checks and
   unresolved review comments.
5. Return to PR monitoring once CI and review status are clean again.

### Step 4b: Re-request review after fixes

When fixes were pushed (from either review or CI remediation) and shadow review
is enabled:

1. Re-request shadow review per `.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md`
   §1.7.
2. Poll for the new review using the same back-off cadence.
3. Resolve any remaining bot-authored threads per §1.6.
4. Repeat until the review is clean or the review-fix cycle limit is
   reached.

### Step 5: Merge approval gate

#### Step 5a: Pre-Merge Review Readiness Verification (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before presenting the PR as merge-ready, run the defense-in-depth
local review readiness verification defined in
`.github/instructions/github-pr-automation.instructions.md` §1.9:

1. Execute the §1.9 readiness query with full pagination until `hasNextPage`
   is false. If pagination cannot complete, fail closed and halt.
2. Evaluate all four gate checks in order:
   - **Check 1**: A local review readiness record exists for the current `headRefOid`.
   - **Check 2**: The local review outcome is `READY` or `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS`.
   - **Check 3**: Any residual P2/P3 findings are explicitly tracked as follow-up items or residual-risk notes.
   - **Check 4**: Code-changing PRs include successful full local build evidence, or
     documentation-only/backlog-only PRs explicitly mark full-build non-applicability.
3. If any check fails, **halt immediately**. Do not present the PR as
   merge-ready. Report the blocking condition to the operator.
4. If advisory shadow-review feedback exists, surface it in the merge-readiness summary without treating it as merge-blocking by default.
5. Surface human review threads, `reviewDecision`, and any
   `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews in the merge-readiness summary — these
   may independently block merge at the GitHub level.
6. In dark mode, this local readiness gate is the authoritative merge-readiness
   gate: unresolved local P0/P1 findings block, `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS` requires
   explicit follow-up handling, and shadow-review unavailability does not block
   unless elevated by the activation contract or operator.

#### Step 5b: Present merge readiness

1. When the §1.9 gate passes and checks are green, present the status
   to the user.
2. Wait for explicit user approval before any merge action.
3. **Never auto-merge** and never treat silence as approval.
4. If the user does not approve merge, leave the PR open and report
   the ready state.
5. **Operator approval gate (P-014)**: After the §1.9 gate passes, wait for an
   explicit operator approval signal. Green CI is not approval. A passing §1.9
   gate is not approval. Record P-014 (via P-005 telemetry) if merge is executed
   without an explicit approval signal.
   When `DARK_MODE_ACTIVE` is present, the activation record may satisfy this
   approval signal only when the PR is inside scope, `merge_approval_pre_authorized`
   is `true`, §1.9 passed for the current HEAD, required checks are green or
   explicitly non-applicable, and P-009/P-016 have passed. Otherwise, wait for
   explicit operator approval.
6. **Branch retention (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Remain on the current feature
   or chore branch while awaiting merge approval. Do NOT checkout
   `main` or any other branch. The calling agent (Ship)
   depends on the branch context being preserved for post-merge work.

#### Step 5c: Last-Mile §1.9 Re-check Before Merge Execution

After receiving operator approval, or after confirming a valid
`DARK_MODE_ACTIVE` approval record, and before executing any normal merge or
admin fallback:

1. Re-query the PR `headRefOid`.
2. Confirm the `headRefOid` still matches the HEAD covered by the latest passed
   §1.9 gate and the PR body's `Reviewed HEAD` value.
3. If the branch advanced, the PR body reviewed SHA differs from `headRefOid`, or
   the latest passed §1.9 gate covered a different SHA, re-run §1.9 in full
   before merge or fallback — the prior gate result is stale.
4. If the branch HEAD and review state are unchanged from the §1.9 gate run,
   log `P-014 LAST-MILE CHECK PASSED: branch unchanged, local readiness still covers HEAD`.
5. Execute the merge or admin fallback only after this check passes.

This last-mile check closes the race window between approval receipt and merge
execution. It is a lightweight incremental query (not a full §1.9 re-run) when the
branch has not changed.

#### Step 5d: Merge Execution and Admin Fallback State Machine

1. Classify the pre-merge normal path. If a merge commit can proceed, record
   `NORMAL_MERGE_READY` before executing the merge command.
2. Attempt the normal merge path first using merge-commit strategy.
3. If normal merge succeeds, record a distinct `MERGE_SUCCEEDED` result with the
   merge SHA and finish.
4. If normal merge is rejected, classify the blocking state before taking any
   fallback action:
   * `REVIEW_REQUIRED_BLOCK`
   * `CONVERSATION_RESOLUTION_BLOCK`
   * `CHECKS_BLOCK`
   * `MERGE_STRATEGY_BLOCK`
   * `MISSING_ADMIN_RIGHTS`
   * `UNKNOWN_MERGE_BLOCK`
5. In dark mode, admin fallback may be attempted only for branch-protection
   review/conversation blocks explicitly covered by `admin_fallback_pre_authorized`.
   Before fallback, run Step 5c's immediate `headRefOid` re-query/comparison and
   re-confirm required checks, P-009 merge-commit strategy, P-016 topology, and
   scope match.
6. Never use admin fallback for failed/pending/missing required checks, stale
   local review readiness, unresolved local P0/P1 findings, squash/rebase-only
   merge strategy, secrets-safety risk, scope mismatch, or unknown merge blocks.
7. Record every normal merge and admin fallback attempt in the PR summary or
   merge evidence with state, reason, command/API used, and result. If fallback
   fails because credentials lack bypass rights, halt with `MISSING_ADMIN_RIGHTS`.

### Step 6: Post-merge cleanup

After a user-approved merge:

1. Report the merge result and resulting default-branch state.
2. **Do NOT checkout `main` and start working on it.**
   Post-merge closure work belongs on a dedicated `post-merge/` branch
   created by the Ship agent. This skill's responsibility ends at
   reporting the merge result.
3. Delete the feature branch only when that cleanup is requested or
   already part of the chosen PR flow.
4. Summarize any follow-up items, release notes, or residual risks
   that remain after merge.

## Completion Criteria

The skill is complete only when one of these outcomes is explicit:

* the PR is open and ready, waiting on user merge approval
* the PR feedback and CI loop is blocked with a clear reason
* the PR was merged after explicit user approval

## Stop Conditions

| Counter | Limit | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Fix-CI delegation cycles | 5 | Halt, leave PR for manual intervention |
| Review-fix cycles | 3 | For each remaining advisory shadow-review comment that FAILS P-021 C1: accept as a backlog follow-up via a full P-021 C2 capture carrying the full six-field payload above (not an informal note). An in-scope comment unresolved solely because this cycle budget is exhausted is NOT captured this way — see the P-021 C4 annotation below. |

**P-021 C4 annotation**: reaching the review-fix cycle limit does not authorize
expanding into an out-of-scope comment, and neither does an operator
instruction to continue. Operator authorization at the limit can only open a
SEPARATE work unit through P-021 C2 capture plus C6 Stage deliberation — it
never makes the expansion in-scope for the cycle already in flight (P-021 C4).
An in-scope comment (one that PASSES P-021 C1) left unresolved purely because
this cycle-count budget is exhausted is a different case: it is never captured
as a `DEFERRED SCOPE EXPANSION` entry (it was never out of scope), and per the
P-021 C3 symmetric guard it MUST NOT be silently closed as a backlog
follow-up either — halt this comment instead and surface it to the operator
for explicit disposition (extend the cycle-count limit, or explicitly accept
documented residual risk) before the PR is presented as merge-ready.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — PR creation and follow-up is routine coordination.
