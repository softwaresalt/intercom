## Skill Search

Search the installed skill registry by keyword and return a summarized list
of matching skills. This prevents context window bloat by loading skill
definitions on demand rather than dumping every skill into the system prompt.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill whenever you need to find a specific capability but do not
already know which skill provides it. Use keyword-based search to narrow down
the right skill, then load only that skill's `SKILL.md` for the duration of
the task.

**Do not load all skills at once.** Use this skill to discover what you need,
then read the specific `SKILL.md` file into context.

## Inputs

* `keyword`: (Required) A search term or phrase describing the capability needed.
  Examples: `"test"`, `"review"`, `"lock"`, `"build"`, `"plan"`, `"safety"`.

## Output

A summarized table of matching skills with:

* Skill name (directory name)
* One-line description (from YAML frontmatter `description` field)
* File path for on-demand loading

## Script

Both PowerShell and Bash equivalents are provided for cross-platform
compatibility. Use whichever matches the runtime environment.

### search (.ps1 / .sh)

Scans all `SKILL.md` files under `.github/skills/` and returns matches
where the keyword appears in the skill name or its YAML frontmatter
description.

```text
PowerShell: scripts/search.ps1 <keyword>
Bash:       scripts/search.sh <keyword>
```

Output format:

```text
SKILL                        DESCRIPTION                                                          PATH
-----                        -----------                                                          ----
build-feature                Execute a harness loop — iteratively run tests...                    .github/skills/build-feature/SKILL.md
harness-architect            Scaffolds compilable but failing test harnesses...                   .github/skills/harness-architect/SKILL.md
```

## Lazy Loading Protocol

Once you identify the right skill via `search.ps1` / `search.sh`:

1. **Read** the specific `SKILL.md` file into context:
   * PowerShell: `Get-Content .github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
   * Bash: `cat .github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
2. **Follow** the skill's instructions for the duration of the current task.
3. **Do not retain** the skill content after the task completes — let it
   leave the context window naturally.

This keeps the active context focused on the current task rather than
carrying every skill's instructions simultaneously.

## Fallback

If `search.ps1` / `search.sh` returns no results:

1. Try broader or alternative keywords.
2. List all available skills:
   * PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem .github/skills/ -Directory | Select-Object Name`
   * Bash: `ls -d .github/skills/*/`
3. If the capability truly does not exist, report it to the operator rather
   than improvising.

## Installed Scripts Registry

All scripts installed by autoharness live in `{workspace}/scripts/`. This
table is the central reference for what exists and where it comes from.

| Script | Source Skill | Platform | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `acquire_lock.ps1` | file-lock | PowerShell | Acquire advisory file lock |
| `acquire_lock.sh` | file-lock | Bash | Acquire advisory file lock |
| `release_lock.ps1` | file-lock | PowerShell | Release advisory file lock |
| `release_lock.sh` | file-lock | Bash | Release advisory file lock |
| `search.ps1` | skill-search | PowerShell | Search skills by keyword |
| `search.sh` | skill-search | Bash | Search skills by keyword |

Scripts are installed conditionally based on selected primitives (Primitive 5
for file-lock, Primitive 6 for skill-search). Not all scripts may be present
in every workspace.
