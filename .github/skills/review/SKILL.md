# Code Review

Reviews code changes using dynamically selected reviewer personas. Spawns persona subagents that return structured findings, then merges and deduplicates into a unified report.

## Agent-Intercom Communication (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Call `ping` at session start. If agent-intercom is reachable, broadcast at every step. If unreachable, warn the user that operator visibility is degraded.

When the `strict-safety` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/strict-safety.instructions.md`: for high-risk diffs, call
out the `ProposedAction`, `ActionRisk`, approval, and rollback gaps that should
be visible before merge or deployment.

## Subagent Depth Constraint

This skill spawns reviewer subagents. Those subagents are leaf executors and MUST NOT spawn their own subagents. Maximum depth: review skill → persona subagent (1 hop).

## Mode Detection

Check arguments for `mode:autofix` or `mode:report-only`. Strip the mode token before interpreting remaining arguments.

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Interactive** (default) | No mode token | Review, present findings, ask for decisions |
| **Autofix** | `mode:autofix` | No user interaction. Apply `safe_auto` fixes only, write artifact, emit residual work |
| **Report-only** | `mode:report-only` | Read-only. Report findings plus a readiness verdict, with no edits or follow-up item creation |

### Autofix mode rules

- Skip all user questions
- Apply only `safe_auto` findings
- Leave `gated_auto`, `manual`, and `advisory` findings unresolved
- Write a review artifact to `docs/closure/`
- Create backlog follow-up items for unresolved actionable findings
- Record a readiness outcome: `READY`, `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS`, or `BLOCKED`
- Never commit, push, or create a PR

### Report-only mode rules

- Skip all user questions
- Never edit files
- Return structured findings plus a readiness outcome to caller
- Do not write a review artifact
- Do not create backlog follow-up items
- Safe for the ship agent to invoke during the build loop

## Severity Scale

| Level | Meaning | Build gate action |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Critical breakage, exploitable vulnerability, data corruption | Block commit |
| **P1** | High-impact defect in normal usage, breaking contract | Block commit |
| **P2** | Moderate issue (edge case, perf, maintainability) | Record as backlog follow-up item |
| **P3** | Low-impact, minor improvement | User's discretion |

## Action Routing

| Class | Default owner | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `safe_auto` | Review skill (autofix mode) | Deterministic local fix |
| `gated_auto` | agent-intercom approval | Fix exists but changes behavior/contracts |
| `manual` | Backlog follow-up item | Actionable work requiring human judgment |
| `advisory` | Informational | Learnings, rollout notes, residual risk |

Routing rules:

- Choose the more conservative route on disagreement between personas
- Only `safe_auto` findings enter the autofix queue
- `requires_verification: true` means a fix needs tests or re-review

## Readiness Outcome Contract

Every review run must produce one of these outcomes for the reviewed HEAD:

| Outcome | Meaning | Ship / PR action |
|---|---|---|
| `READY` | Zero unresolved P0/P1 findings and no required follow-up items | PR may be prepared |
| `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS` | Zero unresolved P0/P1 findings, but one or more P2/P3 findings need explicit follow-up tracking or residual-risk notes | PR may be prepared only with follow-up handling recorded |
| `BLOCKED` | One or more unresolved P0/P1 findings remain | Do not create or present a PR |

The readiness summary must include:

* reviewed HEAD SHA or equivalent diff identity
* counts for P0, P1, P2, and P3 findings
* follow-up item IDs or residual-risk notes when outcome is `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS`
* whether runtime verification follow-up is required

### Local Review Readiness and Dark Mode

This readiness outcome is the local review record consumed by Ship and
pr-lifecycle before PR presentation. When `DARK_MODE_ACTIVE` is present under
P-017, this local review record is the authoritative merge-readiness signal:

* unresolved P0/P1 findings always produce `BLOCKED`
* `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS` must include concrete follow-up item IDs or explicit
  residual-risk notes
* hosted Copilot/GitHub review cannot replace this local review record
* advisory shadow-review comments are follow-ups by default unless the operator
  or policy explicitly elevates them to blocking status
* the reviewed HEAD SHA or equivalent diff identity must be current when the PR
  readiness block is written

## Reviewer Personas

### Always-On (every review)

| Persona Subagent | Focus |
|---|---|
| **Constitution Reviewer** | Constitutional compliance |
| **Go Reviewer** | Language-specific safety and correctness |
| **Correctness Reviewer** | Logic errors, edge cases, and behavioral correctness |
| **Maintainability Reviewer** | Complexity, coupling, and premature abstraction |
| **Learnings Researcher** | Search compound library for related past issues |

### Conditional (based on changed files)

Use a different model from the caller when available to force genuine diversity of critique. Cross-model is preferred but not blocking. For high-risk template, policy, review-surface, or schema/skill diffs, one eligible conditional persona may use the `model_routing.anchor_review` anchor reviewer route when model-specific dispatch is available. If unavailable, record declared degradation and apply the same rubric with the caller's model rather than skipping the persona.

| Persona Subagent | Select when diff touches | Suggested Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture Strategist** | Module boundaries, new abstractions, dependency changes | Different from caller |
| **Concurrency Reviewer** | Concurrent/async patterns | Different from caller |
| **Scope Boundary Auditor** | Changes spanning multiple domains or exceeding expected scope | Different from caller |
| **Agent-Native Parity Reviewer** | MCP SDKs, tool handlers, agent-exposed actions, or user/agent parity-critical flows | Different from caller |
| **Security Reviewer** | Auth middleware, public endpoints, input handling, permission checks, secret management | Different from caller |
| **Template Integrity Reviewer** | `.tmpl` files, Markdown workflow assets, generated artifact references, or policy/instruction surfaces | Different from caller |
| **Schema-CLI-Docs Coupling Reviewer** | Cross-domain diffs spanning schemas, CLI verification logic, install/tune skills, and operator docs | Different from caller |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Review Scope

1. Identify changed files from git diff, explicit file list, or caller-provided scope
2. Categorize each file by type and domain
3. Identify which instruction files apply (via `applyTo` patterns)
4. Broadcast the diff analysis

### Step 2: Route Personas

1. Always-on: spawn Constitution Reviewer, Go Reviewer, Correctness Reviewer, Maintainability Reviewer, Learnings Researcher
2. Conditional: analyze changed file paths, content patterns, and workspace agent-native signals to select additional personas:
   * Select **Security Reviewer** (`security-reviewer.agent.md`) when the diff touches: authentication or authorization code, public endpoint handlers, user input processing, permission or role checks, secret or credential management, or files matching `WebSocket upgrade authentication/authorization, origin validation, token handling, goroutine/lock lifecycle around shared session state, and safe decoding of polymorphic protocol messages.`
   * Select **Template Integrity Reviewer** (`template-integrity-reviewer.agent.md`) when the diff touches template files, Markdown harness artifacts, review/policy/instruction assets, or generated-artifact reference tables
   * Select **Schema-CLI-Docs Coupling Reviewer** (`schema-cli-docs-coupling-reviewer.agent.md`) when the diff spans schema files, `src/` verification logic, install/tune skills, or operator-facing documentation in the same change set
3. When `model_routing.anchor_review` is dispatchable and the diff touches high-risk template, policy, review-surface, or schema/skill contracts, assign the anchor reviewer to one triggered conditional persona (Template Integrity Reviewer by default, otherwise Schema-CLI-Docs Coupling Reviewer). If model-specific dispatch is unavailable, record `TOOL_DEGRADED: model-specific-review-routing — declared fallback: same-model rubric pass` and apply the same rubric.
4. Broadcast the routing decision with persona count, anchor reviewer assignment, and any declared degradation

### Step 3: Spawn Persona Subagents

Spawn all selected personas. Each receives:

- The list of changed files with line ranges
- The diff content relevant to their domain
- Instructions to return structured findings
- Codebase search directive (use grep/glob for context)

Broadcast each spawn.

### Step 4: Collect and Merge Findings

As each persona returns:

1. Broadcast the return with finding count
2. Collect all findings
3. Deduplicate: merge findings that identify the same issue
4. Assign final severity (more conservative on disagreement)
5. Assign final action routing
6. Derive the readiness outcome:
   * `BLOCKED` if any unresolved P0/P1 findings remain
   * `READY_WITH_FOLLOWUPS` if P0/P1 is clear but actionable P2/P3 findings require backlog follow-up or explicit residual-risk notes
   * `READY` otherwise

### Step 5: Apply Actions (mode-dependent)

**Interactive mode:**

1. Present findings grouped by severity (P0 first)
2. For each P0/P1, ask the user to accept, modify, or reject the recommendation
3. Apply approved fixes

**Autofix mode:**

1. Apply all `safe_auto` findings automatically
2. Create backlog follow-up items for unresolved actionable findings
3. Write review artifact to `docs/closure/`
4. Include the readiness outcome, reviewed HEAD, and follow-up item IDs in the artifact

**Report-only mode:**

1. Return structured findings and the readiness outcome to caller
2. No side effects: no edits, no review artifact, no follow-up items

When the diff changes runtime surfaces, include an explicit recommendation for whether follow-up runtime verification is required and which mode (`manual`, `api`, `browser`) is appropriate.

When the diff includes destructive potential, contract changes, migrations,
security-sensitive edits, or other high-blast-radius work, include an explicit
recommendation for whether strict-safety action classification or approval
follow-up is required before merge or deployment.

When the `adversarial-review` capability pack is installed and this review surfaces 3 or more
P0/P1 findings, recommend escalation to the `adversarial-review` agent for multi-model consensus
validation before blocking the build.

## Quality Criteria

* Every changed file is reviewed by at least the always-on personas
* All P0 findings are addressed before the review is marked complete
* P1 findings require explicit acknowledgment (fix or defer with rationale)
* The review report accurately reflects all findings and their resolution status


## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — review coordination and finding assembly.
