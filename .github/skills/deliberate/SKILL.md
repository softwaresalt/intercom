description: "Interactively deliberate on a request, feature, or chore — frame the problem, research options, compare trade-offs, and produce a decision artifact that links into the backlog queue"
---

## Deliberate

Explore WHAT to build and WHY through structured operator dialogue. Produces a
decision artifact that captures the problem frame, research findings, evaluated
options, recommendation, and backlog-link targets. The artifact feeds directly
into `impl-plan` for technical planning or into the backlog queue as a stashed
work item for future pursuit.

This skill focuses on option selection and rationale: research synthesis, option
comparison, and queue/stash linkage. It complements `brainstorm`, the front-door
requirements-intake skill that shapes WHAT to build (stable requirements, success
criteria, scope) before planning. Use `brainstorm` for requirements intake and
`deliberate` for architectural, policy, or tooling trade-off decisions; either
may hand off to `impl-plan`.

## When to Use

Invoke when the operator wants to think through a feature, chore, request, or
architectural question before committing to implementation. Use for:

* Problem framing and requirements shaping
* Targeted research and findings presentation
* Option evaluation and trade-off analysis
* Deferring work into a queue or stash for later pursuit
* Any time the operator says "deliberate", "let's think through", "explore
  options", "what are our choices", or "help me decide"

## Inputs

* `topic`: (Required) The feature idea, chore idea, request, or question to deliberate on.
* `depth`: (Optional) `lightweight`, `standard`, or `deep`. Defaults to `standard`.
* `promote_to`: (Optional) Where the outcome should go after deliberation:
  `plan` (feed into impl-plan), `queue` (stash for later), `both` (plan + queue),
  `none` (leave the artifact unlinked), or `ask` (ask the operator at the end).
  Defaults to `ask`.

## Output

A decision artifact at `docs/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-deliberation.md`.

When `promote_to` includes `queue`, also creates or updates a work item in
`.backlogit/queue/` linking the decision artifact for future pursuit.

When `promote_to` includes `plan`, the artifact path is passed to `impl-plan`
as its source document.

## Required Protocol

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-intercom.instructions.md`: establish heartbeat /
ping visibility at the start of deliberation, broadcast major phase transitions,
and use the intercom clarification flow when the operator needs to be consulted
between phases.

When the `agent-engram` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-engram.instructions.md`: verify the engram search
surface before relying on indexed discovery, and prefer engram-first lookup
while researching the codebase.

When the `graphtor-docs` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/graphtor-docs.instructions.md`: prefer graphtor-docs indexed
documentation retrieval for concept, API, and prior-art documentation lookup before
broad grep or web search. Use Engram for code relationships and graphtor-docs for
documentation, API, and concept lookup.

### Phase 1: Frame the Problem

#### Step 1.1: Classify Depth

| Depth | Criteria | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Lightweight** | Single, well-defined question | 1-2 questions, then document |
| **Standard** | Multi-faceted feature, chore, or request | Full 5-phase protocol |
| **Deep** | Complex system change or architectural decision | All phases + extended research + risk modeling |

#### Step 1.2: Understand the Request

Ask focused questions to establish:

* The problem being solved (user pain, technical need, business goal)
* Who cares about the outcome and why
* Constraints and requirements (performance, compatibility, security, timeline)
* Success criteria (how do we know we chose well?)
* Scope boundaries (what is explicitly out of scope?)

Capture the operator's answers as the **problem frame** section of the artifact.

### Phase 2: Research

#### Step 2.1: Retrieve Prior Knowledge

Search the learnings library (`docs/compound/`) for relevant
past solutions, decisions, and gotchas BEFORE deeper investigation. Treat
retrieval as mandatory pre-research context, not optional.

When the `agent-engram` capability pack is installed, prefer `unified_search`
for broad discovery, `list_symbols` for inventory, and `query_memory` for prior
session context.

When the `graphtor-docs` capability pack is installed, prefer `search_local_docs`,
`search_semantic`, and `research_topic` for documentation, API, and concept lookup;
reserve Engram for code relationships and graphtor-docs for documentation and API
questions.

#### Step 2.2: Investigate the Codebase

Use workspace search tools to understand:

* Existing patterns and conventions relevant to the topic
* Modules, symbols, and integration points that would be affected
* Precedents — how similar problems were solved before
* Constraints imposed by the current architecture

#### Step 2.3: External Research (Deep only)

For `deep` scope, investigate beyond the codebase:

* Technology alternatives and ecosystem options
* Known pitfalls, performance characteristics, and compatibility risks
* Community consensus or best practices

Present research findings to the operator before moving to options.

### Phase 3: Evaluate Options

#### Step 3.1: Identify Options

Based on research, identify 2-4 viable approaches. For each option, specify:

* **Name**: A short, descriptive label
* **Description**: What this approach entails
* **Pros**: Advantages and strengths
* **Cons**: Disadvantages and risks
* **Effort estimate**: Relative complexity (low / medium / high)
* **Fit**: How well it matches the stated constraints and success criteria

#### Step 3.2: Compare Trade-offs

Present a structured comparison to the operator:

| Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|---|---|---|---|
| Complexity | … | … | … |
| Risk | … | … | … |
| Alignment with constraints | … | … | … |

#### Step 3.3: Discuss and Refine

Engage the operator in evaluating the options. The operator may:

* Ask for deeper analysis of a specific option
* Introduce new constraints or preferences
* Combine elements from multiple options
* Request additional research

Iterate until the operator is satisfied or explicitly defers the decision.

### Phase 4: Decide and Link

#### Step 4.1: Capture the Decision

Record the operator's decision (or explicit deferral) with:

* **Recommendation**: The chosen approach and rationale
* **Rejected alternatives**: Why other options were set aside
* **Unresolved questions**: Items that need further investigation
* **Risks and mitigations**: Known risks of the chosen approach

#### Step 4.2: Determine Promotion Path

If `promote_to` was not specified or is `ask`, present the operator with
promotion options:

* **Plan now** → hand the artifact to `impl-plan` as a source document
* **Queue for later** → create a queue entry linking the artifact
* **Both** → plan immediately AND stash a queue reference for tracking
* **None** → leave the artifact in `docs/decisions/` without linking

#### Step 4.3: Execute Promotion

**When promoting to plan:**

Pass the artifact path to the downstream planning flow. The artifact satisfies
the same source-document contract that `impl-plan` expects:

* Problem frame maps to requirements
* Recommendation maps to chosen approach
* Success criteria carry forward

**When promoting to queue:**

If the promoted top-level work is a maintenance, migration, tech-debt, or internal-improvement stream that must ship together, classify it as a **chore** rather than a feature.

When the `backlogit` capability pack is installed and the backlog tool supports
`create_task` operations, create a queue entry through the backlog tool:

* Title derived from the deliberation topic
* Description linking to the decision artifact path
* Status set to `queued`
* Labels include `deliberation-outcome`
* Reference the artifact path in the description or a comment

When `backlog-md` is the installed backlog tool, create a queue entry using
`backlogit_create_item` with `title` derived from the deliberation topic,
`description` linking to the decision artifact path,
`status: "queued"`, and `labels: ["deliberation-outcome"]`.

When no backlog tool is available, append a structured entry to
`.backlogit/queue/.stash.md`:

```markdown
- **[{YYYY-MM-DD}] {topic}** — `docs/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-deliberation.md`
  Status: queued | Decided: {yes/no/deferred}
```

When the `backlogit` capability pack is installed and comment operations are
supported, append a summary comment to the created queue entry with the
recommendation rationale.

### Phase 5: Write the Decision Artifact

Produce the artifact with this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "{{TITLE}}"
description: "{{ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION}}"
topic: "{{TOPIC}}"
depth: "{{DEPTH}}"
decision_status: "decided|deferred|exploring"
promoted_to: "plan|queue|both|none"
linked_artifacts:
  - "{{LINKED_PLAN_OR_QUEUE_PATH}}"
tags:
  - "{{TAG_1}}"
  - "{{TAG_2}}"
---

## Problem Frame

{{PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION}}

## Research Findings

{{RESEARCH_SUMMARY}}

## Options Evaluated

### Option A: {{NAME}}

{{DESCRIPTION_PROS_CONS}}

### Option B: {{NAME}}

{{DESCRIPTION_PROS_CONS}}

## Trade-off Comparison

| Criterion | Option A | Option B |
|---|---|---|
| … | … | … |

## Decision

{{RECOMMENDATION_AND_RATIONALE}}

## Rejected Alternatives

{{WHY_OTHER_OPTIONS_WERE_SET_ASIDE}}

## Unresolved Questions

{{ITEMS_NEEDING_FURTHER_INVESTIGATION}}

## Risks and Mitigations

{{KNOWN_RISKS_AND_MITIGATION_STRATEGIES}}
```

## Quality Criteria

* Problem is clearly framed from the operator's perspective
* Research findings are grounded in codebase evidence and prior learnings
* At least 2 options are presented for standard and deep scopes
* Trade-offs are structured and comparable, not vague prose
* Decision rationale is explicit — the artifact should explain WHY, not just WHAT
* Scope boundaries are explicit (what is NOT included)
* Unresolved questions are captured for follow-up
* Promotion path is executed — the artifact is linked, not orphaned
* When backlog tool operations are available, queue entries are created through
  the tool rather than only as markdown

## Resumption Protocol

If the skill is interrupted (context overflow, session timeout, or operator
halt), write a checkpoint to `docs/memory/` capturing: current phase,
options explored, operator decisions recorded, and next step. On re-invocation,
check for an existing checkpoint. If found, resume from the recorded phase
rather than restarting from scratch.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 3 (Frontier)** — structured decision-making and option evaluation require deep analysis.
