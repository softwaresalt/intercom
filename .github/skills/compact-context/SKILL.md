description: "Compact and consolidate memory, plan, and tracking artifacts into durable summaries in docs/ — mandatory workflow step, not advisory"
---

## Compact Context

Scan `docs/memory/`, `docs/plans/`, and `docs/closure/` for stale or oversized artifacts, produce compacted summaries, and archive verbose originals. For plans with appended reviews, consolidate into a decided-plan that replaces the original plan + review verbosity.

This skill is a **mandatory workflow step** invoked explicitly by the stage or ship agent (when checkpoint threshold is exceeded or at batch completion). It is NOT advisory — built-in AI assistant memory features do not write to `docs/`, so compaction is the only mechanism that ensures session knowledge is consolidated into durable, version-controlled artifacts.

## When to Use

Invoke as part of the standard workflow:

* **Stage or Ship agent**: When checkpoint count for a feature or chore exceeds 10 (mandatory trigger)
* **Ship agent**: At every post-merge closure (mandatory per-merge trigger — **P-020**), after writing the session memory summary
* **Manual**: When `docs/memory/` file count > 40, total size > 500 KB, or the operator requests it

> **Invocation is mandatory; candidate selection is threshold-gated.** P-020 mandates
> that Ship **invokes** this skill at every post-merge closure. It does not mandate
> heavy compaction: the **candidate selection** below stays threshold-gated
> (`threshold_days`, `max_files`, `max_size_kb`; active checkpoints are never
> compacted). One candidate is intended per merge — the just-closed release unit's
> memory qualifies under the completed-work rule (Phase 2, "completed feature or
> chore") — so the guaranteed call performs a **bounded, cheap Tier-1 consolidation**
> of that fresh memory (the intended post-merge floor), degrading to a scan-only
> no-op only when no completed-work memory exists and nothing else exceeds the
> thresholds.

## Inputs

* `target`: (Optional) One of `memory`, `plans`, `all`. Defaults to `all`.
* `threshold_days`: (Optional, default 14) Files older than this are candidates for compaction.
* `max_files`: (Optional, default 40) File count threshold that triggers compaction.
* `max_size_kb`: (Optional, default 500) Total size threshold in KB.

## Output

* Compacted summary files in `docs/memory/` (for memory/checkpoints)
* Decided-plan files in `docs/plans/` (for plans with appended reviews)
* Compacted closure summaries in `docs/closure/` (for verification and closure records)
* Verbose originals moved to `docs/archive/`
* Summary report of what was compacted

## Required Protocol

### Phase 1: Assess

> **Intercom**: When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, broadcast `[COMPACT] Starting compaction: target={target}` before scanning.

Scan the target directories:

**Memory and checkpoints** (`docs/memory/`):

* Count files and total size per date subdirectory
* Identify files older than `threshold_days`
* Cross-reference against active backlog work items (do not compact active task checkpoints)

**Plans** (`docs/plans/`):

* Identify plans with appended review sections (plan-review skill appends findings)
* Identify plans whose associated feature or chore is complete (all tasks Done)

**Closure records** (`docs/closure/`):

* Identify verification and closure artifacts for completed features or chores

### Phase 2: Identify Candidates

Mark artifacts as compaction candidates if:

* **Memory files**: Older than threshold AND not referenced by any active work item
* **Memory files**: Part of a completed feature or chore (all tasks Done)
* **Memory files**: Superseded by a more recent checkpoint for the same task
* **Plans**: Feature or chore is complete AND plan has appended review content ready for consolidation
* **Closure records**: Feature or chore is complete AND more than `threshold_days` old

> **Intercom**: When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, broadcast `[COMPACT] Candidates identified: {count} files` after candidate identification is complete.

### Phase 3: Compact

**Memory compaction** (per-release-unit or per-date group):

1. Read all candidate memory/checkpoint files in the group
2. Generate a dense summary capturing: decisions made, files modified, key learnings, failed approaches, outcomes
3. Write the compacted summary to `docs/memory/compacted/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{release-unit-or-slug}-compacted.md`
4. Move verbose originals to `docs/archive/memory/`

**Plan consolidation** (per-plan):

1. Read the plan file including all appended review sections
2. Extract: final decisions, implementation units that survived review, key constraints, rejected alternatives
3. Write a decided-plan to `docs/plans/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-decided-plan.md` — a concise document containing only the actionable decisions and rationale, not the full deliberation history
4. Move the verbose original plan to `docs/archive/plans/`

**Closure compaction** (per-release-unit):

1. Read verification and closure artifacts for the completed feature or chore
2. Generate a consolidated closure record: what was verified, healthy/failure signals, monitoring status, follow-up items
3. Write the compacted closure to `docs/closure/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-closure-summary.md`
4. Move verbose originals to `docs/archive/closure/`

### Phase 4: Report

Summarize:

* Files compacted: {{count}}
* Space recovered: {{size_reduction}}
* Active task checkpoints preserved: {{count}}
* Plans consolidated into decided-plans: {{count}}
* Closure records compacted: {{count}}

> **Intercom**: When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, broadcast `[COMPACT] Compacted {count} files, recovered {size_reduction}` after the summary is produced.

## Behavioral Constraints

* Never delete files — always archive to `docs/archive/`
* Never compact checkpoints for active (Active status) work items
* Preserve the most recent checkpoint for each completed task
* All archive operations maintain a traceable path from the compacted summary back to the original verbose artifacts
* Decided-plans must preserve all final decisions and their rationale — compaction removes verbosity, not substance

## Intercom Events

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, broadcast the
following events at the specified trigger points:

| Event | Trigger | Broadcast format |
|---|---|---|
| `start` | Skill invoked (Phase 1 begin) | `[COMPACT] Starting compaction: target={target}` |
| `candidates` | Phase 2 complete | `[COMPACT] Candidates identified: {count} files` |
| `complete` | Phase 4 report produced | `[COMPACT] Compacted {count} files, recovered {size_reduction}` |

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 1 (Fast/Cheap)** — summarization and consolidation are low-complexity.
Recommended model class: GPT-5.4-mini, Claude Haiku, or equivalent fast/cheap tier.
