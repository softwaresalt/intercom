# Security Audit

Performs a comprehensive security audit of the workspace across agentic configuration surfaces and application source code. Produces a scored, graded security report.

## Invocation

```
Invoke security-audit [mode:report|mode:fix] [scope:full|scope:config|scope:owasp|scope:stride|scope:<path>]
```

**Defaults**: `mode:report`, `scope:full`

**mode:report** — Analyze and report findings. Never modify files.
**mode:fix** — Apply config-tier fixes only (Tier 1 deterministic fixes). Never auto-fix OWASP or STRIDE findings.

**scope:full** — Run all phases (default)
**scope:config** — Run Phase 1 (discovery) and Phases 2–3 (config audit only)
**scope:owasp** — Run Phase 1 (discovery) and Phase 4 (OWASP source scan)
**scope:stride** — Run Phase 1 (discovery) and Phase 5 (STRIDE threat model)
**scope:\<path\>** — Run full audit (all phases) scoped to the specified path; config phases apply only if the path intersects config surfaces

## Subagent Depth Constraint

This is a leaf executor. No subagent spawning. Maximum depth: 0.

## Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `**/.github/{agents,skills,prompts}/**` | Glob patterns for agentic config files (e.g., `.github/**`, `.vscode/**`) |
| `**/*.go` | Application source file patterns (e.g., `src/**/*.go`) |
| `Go` | Primary language for pattern selection |
| `docs/security` | Output directory for persisted reports (default: `docs/security`) |
| `Never commit secrets/tokens; load them from environment or a secret store. Validate Dev Tunnel / OAuth identity before accepting WebSocket upgrades; default `--allow-anonymous` to false. Keep TLS/origin checks strict.` | Per-environment config rule table |
| `Injection, broken authentication, sensitive-data exposure, missing origin/CSRF checks on the WebSocket upgrade, and improper access control on remote tool-approval routing.` | Language-specific OWASP detection patterns |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

**Skip condition**: Always runs. For focused scopes, discovery narrows to the relevant surfaces:
- `scope:config` — enumerate only agentic config surfaces
- `scope:owasp` or `scope:stride` — enumerate only application source entry points
- `scope:<path>` — enumerate only files under the specified path
- `scope:full` — enumerate all surfaces

1. Enumerate agentic config surfaces matching `**/.github/{agents,skills,prompts}/**`
2. Enumerate application source files matching `**/*.go`
3. Identify the primary language (`Go`) and select corresponding OWASP patterns
4. Record the audit scope, file counts, and entry points found

### Phase 2: Config Tier 1 — Deterministic Config Scan

**Skip condition**: Skip unless `scope:full`, `scope:config`, or `scope:<path>` where the scoped path intersects config surfaces.

Apply deterministic regex checks to config surfaces found in Phase 1. Findings in this tier are eligible for `mode:fix` auto-remediation.

Rules from `Never commit secrets/tokens; load them from environment or a secret store. Validate Dev Tunnel / OAuth identity before accepting WebSocket upgrades; default `--allow-anonymous` to false. Keep TLS/origin checks strict.`:

* Hardcoded credential patterns (passwords, tokens, keys) in config files
* Overly permissive tool allow-lists (e.g., `always: true` on destructive terminal commands)
* Missing input validation rules in agent instruction files
* Exposed secrets in environment variable defaults
* Missing branch protection or CI security gate references

For each match: record file, line number, matched pattern, severity, and fix action.

### Phase 3: Config Tier 2 — LLM-Assessed Config Rules

**Skip condition**: Skip unless `scope:full`, `scope:config`, or `scope:<path>` where the scoped path intersects config surfaces.

Evaluate config files that require semantic interpretation rather than regex matching:

* Agent instruction files that grant broad tool permissions without scope constraints
* CI workflows that allow arbitrary code execution from pull requests
* Dependency configuration files with unpinned versions in security-sensitive packages
* Agentic tool configurations that bypass the workspace's own safety policies

Apply judgment: record findings with reasoning, not just pattern matches. These findings are advisory in `mode:fix` — they require human review before action.

### Phase 4: OWASP Top 10 Source Scan

**Skip condition**: Skip unless `scope:full`, `scope:owasp`, or `scope:<path>`.

Scan source files matching `**/*.go` (or the specified path) using `Injection, broken authentication, sensitive-data exposure, missing origin/CSRF checks on the WebSocket upgrade, and improper access control on remote tool-approval routing.`:

| Category | What to look for |
|---|---|
| A01: Broken Access Control | Authorization checks missing at data-object layer, not just route layer |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | Sensitive data stored or transmitted without encryption; weak hash algorithms |
| A03: Injection | String-built queries, unparameterized SQL, unescaped template values, shell command construction from inputs |
| A04: Insecure Design | Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints, missing CSRF protection on state-changing routes |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | Default credentials, debug endpoints, verbose error responses in production paths |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | Package manifests with known-vulnerable pinned versions (if detectable without network) |
| A07: Auth Failures | Session token generation entropy, missing invalidation on logout, fixation vulnerabilities |
| A08: Software Integrity | Dynamic import of unvalidated paths, deserialization of untrusted data |
| A09: Logging Failures | Sensitive values (passwords, tokens, PII) interpolated into log statements |
| A10: SSRF | URL parameters passed to HTTP clients without allowlist validation |

**OWASP findings are report-only.** Do not auto-fix source code even in `mode:fix`.

### Phase 5: STRIDE Threat Model

**Skip condition**: Skip unless `scope:full`, `scope:stride`, or `scope:<path>`.

Apply a lightweight STRIDE analysis to the system's trust model:

| Threat | Question |
|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Can an attacker impersonate a user, service, or agent? |
| **Tampering** | Can inputs or stored data be modified without detection? |
| **Repudiation** | Can actors deny their actions? Is sufficient audit logging present? |
| **Information Disclosure** | Can sensitive data be accessed by unauthorized parties? |
| **Denial of Service** | Can resource exhaustion or crash loops be triggered from external inputs? |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Can an actor gain higher privileges than intended? |

For each STRIDE category, identify the highest-risk finding from the workspace scan. Report STRIDE findings as advisory — they describe design-level risks, not specific exploitable code patterns. STRIDE findings do not require an exact `file:line` location; provide an "evidence anchor" (the specific system component, data flow, or design decision that introduces the risk) instead.

### Phase 6: Score and Grade

Compute the security score using this deduction model applied to a 100-point baseline:

| Severity | Deduction |
|---|---|
| Critical (P0) | -15 per finding |
| High (P1) | -10 per finding |
| Medium (P2) | -5 per finding |
| Low (P3) | -2 per finding |

**N/A semantics**: If a category does not apply to the workspace (e.g., no web routes → A10 SSRF is N/A), exclude it from scoring rather than scoring it as 0 findings.

Final grade:

| Score | Grade |
|---|---|
| 90–100 | A — Low risk |
| 75–89 | B — Moderate risk, remediation advised |
| 60–74 | C — Elevated risk, remediation required before release |
| < 60 | F — High risk, block release until critical/high findings resolved |

### Phase 7: Output

Produce a structured report with:

1. **Executive Summary** — score, grade, finding counts by severity, top 3 risks, audit scope and date
2. **Config Audit Results** (Phases 2–3) — findings grouped by rule category
3. **OWASP Scan Results** (Phase 4) — findings grouped by A01–A10 category
4. **STRIDE Analysis** (Phase 5) — one entry per STRIDE category with the highest-risk finding and its rationale
5. **Remediation Priority List** — ordered action list: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3, each with location, description, and remediation steps
6. **Applied Fixes** (mode:fix only) — list of Tier 1 config fixes applied with before/after diff

### Phase 8: Persist

Save the report to `docs/security/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-security-audit.md` where `YYYY-MM-DD` is today's date and `HH-MM` is the current time (24-hour). The time component prevents clobbering earlier runs on the same day when the skill is invoked multiple times (different scopes or modes).

If `docs/security/` does not exist, create it before writing.

Report the saved path on completion.

## Mode Rules

**mode:report** (default):
* Read and search only
* Never modify source or config files
* Report all findings with location and remediation guidance

**mode:fix**:
* Apply only Phase 2 (Tier 1 deterministic) config fixes
* Config fixes must be file edits with clear before/after rationale
* Never modify application source code
* Never apply Phase 3, 4, or 5 findings as auto-fixes
* After applying fixes, re-run Phase 2 to confirm the fix resolved the finding

## Quality Criteria

* Every phase that is in scope must run before the report is considered complete
* Skipped phases must be noted in the executive summary with the skip reason
* All findings include a specific file:line location, except STRIDE findings which require an evidence anchor (component, data flow, or design decision) instead of an exact line number
* The report is persisted to `docs/security/` before the audit is marked complete

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** for config audit phases and **Tier 3 (Frontier)** for OWASP and STRIDE analysis phases. If only a single model is available, use it for all phases.
