description: "Time-boxed investigation of a technical question, feasibility study, or proof-of-concept — produces a findings artifact with a recommendation and optional backlog linkage"

## Spike

Execute a focused, time-boxed investigation to answer a specific technical
question or evaluate feasibility. Produces a findings artifact that captures
the investigation goal, approach, evidence, and recommendation. The artifact
can be promoted to the planning pipeline, linked to a feature or chore as a prerequisite,
or captured as a compound learning for institutional knowledge.

A spike replaces what was previously called "research" in the backlog structure.
Unlike a deliberation (which produces a *decision* through interactive operator
dialogue), a spike produces *findings* through hands-on investigation — reading
code, prototyping, benchmarking, or evaluating external tools.

## When to Use

* The operator or stage agent identifies unknowns that require investigation
  before committing to an implementation approach
* A feature or chore has technical risk that should be explored in isolation
* A proof-of-concept is needed to validate feasibility
* The team needs to evaluate external libraries, tools, or APIs
* Performance characteristics need measurement before design decisions
* Migration paths need assessment and comparison

## When NOT to Use

* The question can be answered through deliberation alone (use `deliberate`)
* The work is implementation, not investigation (use `build-feature`)
* The investigation is debugging a specific failure (that's a bug fix, not a spike)

## Inputs

* `goal`: (Required) The specific question the spike must answer, stated as a
  question or hypothesis.
* `time_box`: (Optional) Maximum duration for the investigation. Defaults to
  `4h`. Accepted values: `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`.
* `scope_constraints`: (Optional) Boundaries on what the spike may and may not
  touch (e.g., "read-only — no production changes", "prototype in a branch only").
* `linked_parent_work_item`: (Optional) Path or ID of a feature or chore this spike informs. When
  provided, the findings artifact references that top-level release unit.
* `promote_to`: (Optional) Where to route the outcome. Accepts a single value
  or a comma-separated list for multiple paths: `plan`, `queue`, `learnings`,
  `none`, `ask`. Defaults to `ask`.
  * `plan` — promote to `impl-plan` for feature or chore planning
  * `queue` — create a queue entry with link to the spike artifact
  * `learnings` — capture as a compound learning entry
  * `none` — leave the artifact in `docs/decisions/` without linking
  * `ask` — ask the operator at the end
  * Combinations are valid (e.g., `plan,learnings`)

## Output

A findings artifact at `docs/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-spike.md` (long-lived
knowledge) with an optional work item in `.backlogit/queue/` for
workflow tracking.

When the `backlogit` capability pack is installed and `promote_to` includes
`queue` (or `ask` resolves to `queue`), the spike is also created as a backlog
work item at conclusion with `artifact_type: spike`, `labels: ["spike"]`, and
a status of `done`. The work item filename follows the configured
suffix convention: `{id}-{suffix}-{slug}.md`. If `promote_to` does not include
`queue`, no backlog work item is created regardless of the installed capability pack.

## Required Protocol

### Phase 1: Scope

#### Step 1.1: Confirm the Investigation Goal

Restate the goal as a precise, answerable question. If the goal is vague,
narrow it until you can describe what a successful answer looks like.

Document:

* **Goal question**: The specific question to answer
* **Success criteria**: What constitutes a sufficient answer (e.g., "we can
  demonstrate a working prototype", "we have latency numbers under load",
  "we have a recommendation with trade-off analysis")
* **Out of scope**: What this spike explicitly will NOT investigate

#### Step 1.2: Establish Constraints

* Confirm the time-box with the operator (default 4h)
* Confirm scope constraints (read-only, branch-only, sandbox, etc.)
* Confirm linked feature or chore if applicable

#### Step 1.3: Check Prior Work

Search for prior spikes, deliberations, and compound learnings on the same
topic to avoid repeating past investigations.

When the `agent-engram` capability pack is installed, prefer indexed search for
related modules, symbols, and prior context before falling back to broader
file scans.

When the `graphtor-docs` capability pack is installed, prefer graphtor-docs indexed
documentation retrieval for concept, API, and prior-art documentation lookup before
broad file or web search — use Engram for code relationships and graphtor-docs for
documentation.

When the `backlogit` capability pack is installed and search is supported, query
the backlog for related spike items, deliberation outcomes, or tasks that may
have already explored this question.

* Search `docs/decisions/` for prior spike artifacts and deliberation outcomes
* Search `docs/compound/` for relevant institutional learnings
* Search `.backlogit/queue/` for related active work items
* If prior work exists, summarize what was already learned and what remains
  unknown

### Phase 2: Investigate

#### Step 2.1: Plan the Approach

Before diving in, outline the investigation approach in 3-5 steps. This keeps
the spike focused and prevents scope creep within the time-box.

#### Step 2.2: Search the Codebase

Mandatory codebase investigation:

* Search the compound learnings library (`docs/compound/`)
  FIRST — treat prior learnings as mandatory pre-investigation context
* Analyze relevant code paths, modules, and patterns
* Identify existing implementations that relate to the question

When the `agent-engram` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-engram.instructions.md`: prefer indexed search for
related modules, symbols, and prior context before falling back to broader file
scans.

When the `graphtor-docs` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/graphtor-docs.instructions.md`: prefer graphtor-docs indexed
documentation retrieval for concept, API, and prior-art documentation lookup before
broad file or web search — Engram for code relationships, graphtor-docs for
documentation.

#### Step 2.3: Hands-On Investigation

Execute the investigation approach:

* Read relevant source code and documentation
* Build prototypes or proofs-of-concept if the goal requires it
* Run benchmarks or measurements if the goal involves performance
* Evaluate external tools or libraries if the goal involves technology selection
* Document evidence as you go — don't rely on memory

**Time-box enforcement**: Track elapsed effort. If the investigation is
approaching the time-box limit:

1. Stop exploring new avenues
2. Consolidate what you have learned so far
3. Proceed to Phase 3 with current findings
4. Note unresolved questions as "needs further investigation"

#### Step 2.4: External Research (When Needed)

If the codebase investigation is insufficient, conduct targeted external
research. Focus on:

* Official documentation for relevant libraries or tools
* Known patterns and anti-patterns for the approach under evaluation
* Community experience with similar migrations or integrations

### Phase 3: Synthesize

#### Step 3.1: Consolidate Findings

Organize investigation evidence into a coherent narrative:

* What was investigated
* What was discovered (with evidence)
* What was tried and failed (with reasons)
* What remains uncertain

#### Step 3.2: Form Recommendation

Based on findings, produce one of:

* **Proceed**: The investigation supports moving forward. Describe the
  recommended approach and any caveats.
* **Pivot**: The investigation suggests a different approach than originally
  expected. Describe the alternative and why.
* **Defer**: More investigation is needed, but the time-box has expired.
  Describe what additional work is required and the remaining unknowns.
* **Abandon**: The investigation reveals the approach is not viable. Describe
  the evidence and suggest alternatives if any exist.

#### Step 3.3: Assess Confidence

Rate confidence in the recommendation:

* **High**: Evidence is strong, multiple signals confirm the recommendation
* **Medium**: Evidence supports the recommendation but some unknowns remain
* **Low**: Limited evidence, significant unknowns persist — treat recommendation
  as tentative

### Phase 4: Conclude and Link

#### Step 4.1: Determine Promotion Path

Present the findings summary and recommendation to the operator. Ask where to
route the outcome (unless `promote_to` was pre-set):

* **Plan**: Findings are actionable — promote to `impl-plan` for feature or chore planning
* **Queue**: Findings inform future work — create a queue entry with link to
  the spike artifact
* **Learnings**: Findings are institutional knowledge — capture as a compound
  learning entry
* **None**: Leave the artifact in `docs/decisions/` for manual reference

The operator may choose multiple paths (e.g., both `plan` and `learnings`).

#### Step 4.2: Promote to Implementation Plan (When Applicable)

When `promote_to` includes `plan` (or `ask` resolved to `plan`):

1. Invoke the **impl-plan** skill with the spike findings artifact as context:
   * Pass the findings artifact path as the plan source
   * Set the implementation scope to the recommendation from Step 3.2
   * Include the spike's success criteria and constraints as planning constraints
2. The impl-plan skill writes a plan document to `docs/plans/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-plan.md`
3. Update the spike findings artifact's `docline.promoted_to` frontmatter field to include
   `plan` and add a `docline.plan_artifact` field pointing to the generated plan path
4. If `linked_parent_work_item` was provided, the impl-plan output should reference that feature or chore
   so the planning chain is traceable

When `plan` is combined with other paths (e.g., `plan,learnings` or `plan,queue`),
complete this step first, then continue with Steps 4.3 and 4.4 for the remaining paths.

If the **stage** agent is active (operator preference over direct impl-plan invocation),
call stage instead and pass the spike artifact as the planning seed. The
stage agent will invoke impl-plan internally and return the plan artifact path.

#### Step 4.3: Create Backlog Item (When Applicable)

When the `backlogit` capability pack is installed and `create_task` is available:

1. Create a spike item with `artifact_type: spike`
2. Set title: the goal question (shortened to 5-10 words)
3. Set description: link to the findings artifact path
4. Set labels: `["spike"]` plus `["deliberation-outcome"]` if the spike was
   triggered from a deliberation
5. Set status: `done` (since the investigation is complete)
6. If `linked_parent_work_item` was provided, set `parent_id` to link the spike to its
  feature or chore

When `backlog-md` is the installed backlog tool:

* If promoting to queue, create a spike item using `backlogit_create_item` with
  `title` from the goal question (shortened to 5-10 words),
  `description` linking to the findings artifact path,
  `status: "done"`, and `labels: ["spike"]`.

When no backlog tool is available:

* If promoting to queue, append a spike entry to
  `.backlogit/queue/.stash.md` with the format:
  ```
  - [{YYYY-MM-DD}] **Spike**: {goal summary}
    Conclusion: {proceed|pivot|defer|abandon} (confidence: {high|medium|low})
    Artifact: `docs/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-spike.md`
    Linked parent work item: {feature/chore reference or "standalone"}
  ```

#### Step 4.4: Capture as Compound Learning (When Applicable)

If the promotion path includes `learnings` or the spike produced insights that
would benefit future work, invoke the **compound** skill with the findings
as source material. The compound entry preserves the spike's key findings in
the institutional knowledge base where the learnings-researcher can surface
them in future tasks.

### Phase 5: Write Findings Artifact

Write the findings artifact to `docs/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-spike.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "{Goal question — short form}"
source: "docs/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-spike.md"
doc_type: decision
description: "{One-sentence summary of the investigation and its outcome}"
docline:
  type: spike
  date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
  time_box: "{time_box value}"
  conclusion: "{proceed|pivot|defer|abandon}"
  confidence: "{high|medium|low}"
  linked_parent_work_item: "{feature or chore path/ID, or null}"
  promoted_to: ["{plan|queue|learnings|none}"]
  tags:
    - "{domain tag}"
    - "{technology tag}"
---

## Goal

{Precise question or hypothesis}

## Success Criteria

{What constitutes a sufficient answer}

## Scope Constraints

{Boundaries on the investigation}

## Investigation Approach

{The 3-5 step approach taken}

## Findings

### What Was Discovered

{Organized evidence and observations}

### What Was Tried and Failed

{Approaches that didn't work and why}

### Remaining Unknowns

{What is still uncertain}

## Recommendation

**Conclusion**: {proceed | pivot | defer | abandon}
**Confidence**: {high | medium | low}

{Detailed recommendation with reasoning}

## Next Steps

{Actions following from the recommendation}

## References

{Links to code paths, documentation, prototypes, benchmarks examined}
```

Substitute the real `{YYYY-MM-DD}` and `{slug}` used for the artifact's own filename into
the `source` field above — `source` must resolve to the artifact's own repo-relative path
(e.g. `docs/decisions/2026-08-16-example-topic-spike.md`), not a literal placeholder. An
artifact whose `source` still contains an unsubstituted `{YYYY-MM-DD}` or `{slug}` is
self-inconsistent even though presence-only lint rules would not catch it.

`description` is handoff-required for downstream consumers even though neither the
`authoring` nor the `ingestion` documentation lint profile currently enforces its
presence — do not treat it as redundant and remove it.

## Quality Criteria

* Goal question is specific and answerable, not open-ended
* Findings are grounded in evidence (code references, measurements, documentation) — not speculation
* Failed approaches are documented with reasons — not silently omitted
* Recommendation includes one of the four conclusion types with a confidence rating
* Time-box was respected — the spike did not expand beyond its declared limit
* If prior spikes or learnings existed on the topic, they were consulted and referenced
* The artifact has valid YAML frontmatter with all required fields
* If a backlog item was created, it has the correct `artifact_type: spike` and labels

## Relationship to Other Workflows

* **Deliberate**: Deliberation produces *decisions* through dialogue; spikes produce *findings* through investigation. A deliberation may trigger a spike when unknowns are identified during Phase 2 (Research).
* **Impl-plan**: Spike findings with a `proceed` or `pivot` conclusion are valid source documents for impl-plan, just like deliberation outcomes.
* **Compound**: Spike findings can be captured as compound learnings for the institutional knowledge base.
* **Build-feature**: Spikes do NOT produce implementation code. If a spike creates a prototype, that prototype lives in a branch and is referenced in findings — it is not the deliverable.

## Resumption Protocol

If the skill is interrupted (context overflow, session timeout, or operator
halt), write a checkpoint to `docs/memory/` capturing: current phase,
evidence gathered, hypotheses formed, and next step. On re-invocation, check
for an existing checkpoint. If found, resume from the recorded phase rather
than restarting from scratch.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 3 (Frontier)** — open-ended investigation requires deep analysis.
