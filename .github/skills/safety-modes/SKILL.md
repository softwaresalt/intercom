description: "Interactive safety workflows for elevated-risk work — careful, freeze-scope, investigate-first, and explicit action-risk/result tracking"

## Safety Modes

Enter an explicit operating mode before performing risky work. This skill slows the agent down on purpose: it surfaces risk, narrows scope, and makes the next action legible to the operator.

## When to Use

Invoke when work has elevated blast radius, uncertain root cause, production impact, or destructive potential.

Typical triggers:

* Destructive commands or large-scale refactors
* Production configuration changes
* Incident debugging with unclear causality
* Work that must stay inside a single directory or subsystem boundary

## Inputs

* `mode`: (Required) One of `careful`, `freeze-scope`, or `investigate-first`.
* `scope`: (Optional) Directory, subsystem, or change boundary for `freeze-scope` mode.
* `context`: (Optional) Description of the risky task or incident.

## Output

* A structured safety checklist for the current work session
* If useful, a written record at `docs/closure/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-safety-check.md`

## Required Protocol

When the `strict-safety` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/strict-safety.instructions.md`: classify risky work as
explicit `ProposedAction` entries with `ActionRisk` and `ActionResult` instead
of leaving those details implicit.

### Step 1: Classify Risk and Proposed Actions

Identify why elevated safety is required:

* Destructive action risk
* Production/runtime risk
* Scope creep risk
* Root-cause uncertainty
* Data loss or security risk

For every risky or boundary-sensitive step, capture a `ProposedAction` with:

* summary of the action
* targets touched
* rollback or containment path
* whether approval is required

Assign the most conservative `ActionRisk`:

* `low`
* `moderate`
* `high`
* `destructive`

### Step 2: Enter the Requested Mode

#### Mode: `careful`

Before changing anything:

1. Enumerate the risky actions that may occur
2. Identify rollback or backup strategy
3. Separate non-destructive steps from destructive ones
4. Require explicit operator approval before destructive steps
5. Mark each risky step's expected `ActionResult` as `planned` until approval or execution changes its state

#### Mode: `freeze-scope`

Before changing anything:

1. Declare the allowed boundary (`scope`)
2. List files and directories inside that boundary
3. **Verify lock availability**: For each file to be modified within the boundary,
   check whether a lock conflict exists (per `concurrency.instructions.md`).
   If lock acquisition fails on a boundary file:
   * Classify the edit as `ActionRisk: high` (lock contention on boundary file)
   * Add the lock conflict to the safety checklist
   * Do not modify the file; retry once after a brief wait
   * If contention persists, prompt the operator to resolve or break the lock and coordinate file ownership before proceeding
4. Refuse edits outside the boundary unless the operator expands scope
5. Re-state the freeze boundary before each risky edit sequence
6. Reject any `ProposedAction` whose targets fall outside the declared boundary

#### Mode: `investigate-first`

Before changing anything:

1. Gather evidence from logs, tests, code paths, and recent changes
2. Produce at least one root-cause hypothesis
3. Distinguish evidence from assumptions
4. Do not apply a fix until the hypothesis is explicit and testable
5. Keep risky fixes in `ActionResult: planned` or `blocked` until the evidence supports them

### Step 3: Produce the Safety Checklist

The checklist MUST include:

* Active mode
* Declared scope or risk boundary
* `ProposedAction` entries with `ActionRisk`
* Actions allowed immediately
* Actions requiring approval
* Expected or current `ActionResult` state for each risky action
* Exit condition for leaving the mode

### Step 4: Record Action Results

When risky actions are approved, attempted, or rejected, update their
`ActionResult`:

* `approved` before execution when approval is granted
* `blocked` when tooling, information, or approval is missing
* `applied` when the action succeeds
* `rolled-back` when the action had to be reversed or mitigated
* `abandoned` when the action is intentionally dropped

### Step 5: Enforcement Gate

When the `strict-safety` capability pack is enabled, the safety checklist is a
**decision gate**, not advisory:

* Actions classified as `ActionRisk: destructive` MUST NOT proceed without
  explicit operator approval recorded as `ActionResult: approved`. Proceeding
  without approval is a policy violation, not a judgment call.
* Actions classified as `ActionRisk: high` SHOULD request operator approval
  before proceeding. If approval is unavailable, record the decision rationale.
* If a `destructive` action proceeds without `ActionResult: approved`, broadcast
  a P-005 violation telemetry event and halt.

When `strict-safety` is **not** enabled, Constitutional Principle VII
(Destructive Command Approval — NON-NEGOTIABLE) still applies. Agents MUST NOT
execute `ActionRisk: destructive` work without explicit operator approval, even
when the safety checklist is advisory. To comply:

* Classify destructive actions as `ActionRisk: destructive` in the checklist
* Record them as `ActionResult: blocked` until operator approval is obtained
* Prompt the operator via the configured interface (intercom if available, else
  console): `Destructive action requires approval: {action_summary}. Approve? [yes/no]`
* Only proceed if the operator responds with explicit approval

## Quality Criteria

* The chosen mode matches the risk profile of the work
* Destructive or high-blast-radius actions are called out explicitly
* Risky actions are legible as `ProposedAction` / `ActionRisk` / `ActionResult`
* Freeze boundaries are concrete, not vague
* Investigate-first mode separates evidence from proposed fixes


## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — risk classification and checklist production.
