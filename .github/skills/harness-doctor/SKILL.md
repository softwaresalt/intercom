# Harness Doctor

Diagnose the health of an installed autoharness harness. Produces a graded per-category health report covering manifest integrity, version drift, file completeness, cross-reference validity, MCP tool availability, and template variable residue.

## When to Use

Invoke when:

* Something in the harness appears broken or out of sync
* Preparing to run tune-harness and you want a baseline health snapshot first
* After a manual edit to harness artifacts to confirm consistency
* At the start of an agent session when MCP tool availability is uncertain (pre-flight mode)

## Invocation

```
Invoke harness-doctor [mode:report|mode:fix]
```

**Default**: `mode:report`

**mode:report** — Diagnose and report only. Never modify files.
**mode:fix** — Apply deterministic low-risk repairs (Phase 7 describes eligible repairs). Never modify application or template source.

## Subagent Depth Constraint

This is a leaf executor. No subagent spawning. Maximum depth: 0.

## Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.autoharness/harness-manifest.yaml` | Path to the installed harness manifest (default: `.autoharness/harness-manifest.yaml`) |
| `1.5.0` | Install-time autoharness version baked at install; recorded for reference. Current-version drift is resolved live via the `autoharness version` CLI, not from this value |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Install Scope Detection

Determine what is installed before running any checks.

1. Check for the harness manifest at `.autoharness/harness-manifest.yaml`.
   * If absent: record **MISSING MANIFEST** — set scope-detection grade to F and skip Phases 2 and 3. Phases 4–6 proceed using directory heuristics.
2. If the manifest is present, load it and extract:
   * `schema_version`
   * `autoharness_version` (the version that performed the install)
   * `installed_at` timestamp
   * `artifacts` — the array of installed artifact objects; each has a `path` (workspace-relative), `checksum`, `primitive`, `template`, and optional `artifact_type`
3. Enumerate artifact directories on disk: `.github/agents`, `.github/skills`, `.github/instructions`, `.github/prompts`, `.github/policies`.
4. Derive the expected directory set from `artifacts[*].path` (extract the top-level `.github/<dir>` prefix from each path). Flag any derived directories absent from disk.

**Phase 1 health signal**:
* All declared artifact dirs present → **PASS**
* One or more missing → **WARN** (directories listed in findings)
* Manifest absent → **FAIL**

---

### Phase 2: Version Check

**Skip condition**: Skip if Phase 1 found no manifest.

Compare the version that performed the install against the current autoharness version.

1. Read `autoharness_version` from the manifest (the version that performed the install).
2. Resolve the **current** autoharness version live by running the `autoharness version` CLI at diagnostic time (this is the version that would perform upgrades).
   * If the CLI is unavailable, current-version resolution has **failed** — do NOT substitute the install-time `1.5.0` value as the current version (comparing install-time against install-time would report a false match). Record **WARN — current autoharness version could not be resolved; drift undetectable** and skip the drift classification below.
3. When the current version is resolved, compare it against the manifest version and classify the drift:

| Condition | Signal |
|---|---|
| Versions match | PASS |
| Patch-level difference | WARN — minor drift, tune-harness recommended |
| Minor-version difference | WARN — drift, tune-harness required |
| Major-version difference | FAIL — breaking drift, reinstall recommended |
| Manifest version field absent | WARN — legacy install, version unknown |
| Current version unresolved (CLI unavailable) | WARN — live current-version resolution failed, drift undetectable |

**Phase 2 health signal**: Highest severity condition found above.

---

### Phase 3: File Integrity

**Skip condition**: Skip if Phase 1 found no manifest.

Verify that each artifact listed in the manifest's `artifacts` array still exists on disk.

1. For each entry in `artifacts`:
   * Resolve `entry.path` as a workspace-relative path.
   * Check existence on disk.
2. Compute a presence rate: `(found / total) * 100`.

| Presence Rate | Signal |
|---|---|
| 100% | PASS |
| 90–99% | WARN — some artifacts missing |
| 75–89% | FAIL — significant artifact loss |
| < 75% | FAIL — critical artifact loss, reinstall recommended |

**Phase 3 health signal**: Signal from the table above.

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Reference Validation

Verify that internal cross-references within harness artifacts resolve correctly.

1. Scan all Markdown files under `.github/agents/`, `.github/skills/`, and `.github/instructions/`.
2. For each file, extract:
   * Markdown links with relative paths (e.g., `[text](../instructions/foo.md)`)
   * Explicit skill invocation references (e.g., `Invoke skill-name`)
   * Agent references (e.g., `spawns sub-agent: foo.agent.md`)
3. For each relative path reference, resolve it relative to the directory of the file that contains the link (not relative to the workspace root), then normalize the result to a workspace-absolute path for existence checking. Flag any normalized path that does not exist on disk.
4. For skill invocations: check that a corresponding skill directory exists under `.github/skills/`.
5. For agent references: check that the corresponding `.agent.md` file exists under `.github/agents/`.

**Phase 4 health signal**:
* Zero broken references → **PASS**
* 1–3 broken references → **WARN**
* 4+ broken references → **FAIL**

---

### Phase 5: MCP Prerequisite Check

Verify that the MCP tools the harness declares as required are currently available.

This phase doubles as a pre-flight gate. Running harness-doctor at session start is a reliable way to confirm tool availability before agents attempt to use them.

1. Read the list of required MCP tool names from the installed harness. Sources (in order):
   * `.github/instructions/` files that list tool names in their frontmatter or body
   * `AGENTS.md` if it enumerates required tools
   * Known harness defaults: `backlogit` (when backlogit capability pack is installed)
2. For each declared tool name, attempt a lightweight connectivity check:
   * Invoke a read-only operation (e.g., list or status) using the tool.
   * Record: tool name, reachable (yes/no), response latency (if measurable).
3. Classify availability:

| Condition | Signal |
|---|---|
| All declared tools reachable | PASS |
| 1 tool unreachable | WARN — degraded capability, list affected workflows |
| 2+ tools unreachable | FAIL — agents will fall back to grep/file operations; operator action needed |
| No tools declared (no capability packs requiring MCP) | PASS (N/A) |

4. For each unreachable tool, list the harness skills and agents that depend on it, so the operator knows which workflows are degraded.

**Phase 5 health signal**: Signal from the table above.

---

### Phase 6: Template Variable Residue

Detect unresolved double-brace placeholders (the pattern `\{\{NAME\}\}`) in installed harness artifacts. Their presence indicates an incomplete or failed installation.

1. Scan all files under `.github/` for patterns matching `\{\{[A-Z_]+\}\}`.
2. Exclude known legitimate uses:
   * Files that are themselves templates (`.tmpl` extension) — skip entirely.
   * Variables inside fenced code blocks that serve as documentation examples only (heuristic: block is illustrative if the surrounding context is a "Variable" table or "Example" section).
3. For each match outside the exclusions: record file, line number, variable name.

**Phase 6 health signal**:
* Zero residue matches → **PASS**
* 1–5 residue matches → **WARN** — partial installation
* 6+ residue matches → **FAIL** — incomplete installation, re-run install-harness

---

### Phase 7: Graded Report

Compute a per-category health grade and produce the consolidated report.

#### Grade Computation

Each phase produces one of: PASS, WARN, FAIL, SKIP, or N/A.

| Phase Signal | Grade |
|---|---|
| PASS | A |
| WARN | B |
| FAIL | F |
| SKIP (due to upstream failure) | — (noted as dependent on upstream phase) |
| N/A | — (not applicable to this workspace) |

Overall harness health grade = lowest individual phase grade (F overrides B overrides A).

#### Report Structure

Produce the health report with these sections:

1. **Summary** — Overall grade, phase-by-phase grade table, diagnosis date and time, manifest path, installed version, current version.
2. **Phase Results** — One subsection per phase (1–6): signal, findings list (if any), and recommended action.
3. **Findings List** — All WARN and FAIL findings consolidated, ordered by severity (FAIL first), each with: phase, location (file:line if applicable), description, and recommended fix.
4. **Repair Actions** (mode:fix only) — List of repairs applied with before/after description.
5. **Pre-Flight Summary** — Boolean checklist for quick session readiness confirmation:
   * `[ ] Manifest present`
   * `[ ] Version current`
   * `[ ] Artifacts complete`
   * `[ ] Cross-references valid`
   * `[ ] MCP tools reachable`
   * `[ ] No variable residue`

#### mode:fix Eligible Repairs

In `mode:fix`, apply only these deterministic, low-risk repairs:

* **Phase 1**: Create missing artifact directories derived from `artifacts[*].path` if the parent path exists (empty directory creation only — never generate content).
* **Phase 6**: Quarantine clearly orphaned `.tmpl` extension files accidentally copied to `.github/` by moving them to `.autoharness/quarantine/` (never delete). Record the source path, destination path, and reason. Prompt the operator to review quarantined files before permanent removal.

All other findings are report-only. Source files, agent definitions, and skill content are never auto-modified by harness-doctor.

After applying repairs, re-run the affected phase to confirm the finding is resolved and update the phase grade accordingly.

---

## Quality Criteria

* All six phases must run (or be explicitly skipped with documented reason) before the report is complete.
* Every finding includes a specific location (file path and line number where applicable).
* The Pre-Flight Summary section is always present and reflects the final phase states.
* In `mode:fix`, the repair list is populated even when no repairs were applied (record "No eligible repairs found").
* The overall grade must be derivable from the phase grades — no subjective inflation.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 1 (Fast/Cheap)**. All checks are deterministic pattern-matching and file system inspection. No complex reasoning is required.
