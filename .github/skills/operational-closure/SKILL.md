## Operational Closure

Turn “implemented” into “safely absorbed by the running system”. This skill creates the artifacts and decisions that close the loop after code review, CI, and runtime verification.

## When to Use

Invoke when a feature, fix, or risky change is ready to hand off into merge, deployment, or post-deploy monitoring.

## Inputs

* `mode`: (Required) One of `pre-merge`, `post-merge`, or `post-deploy`.
* `context`: (Required) PR, task, feature, or release context.
* `verification_report`: (Optional) Path to the runtime verification report.
* `validator_evidence`: (Optional) Structured handoff from runtime-verification describing surface adapters, probe outcomes, manual checkpoint evidence, and verdict.
* `releasability_expectations`: (Optional) Structured requirements from `runtime_validation.releasability`.

## Output

* Closure artifact at `docs/closure/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-closure.md`
* Structured releasability evidence summarizing whether the change is `READY`, `READY_WITH_CONDITIONS`, or `BLOCKED`
* A **compaction status** field (`pending` → `done` / `degraded`) recording P-020 post-merge context compaction state
* Follow-up tasks or compound-learnings triggers when needed

## Required Protocol

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, follow
`.github/instructions/agent-intercom.instructions.md`: broadcast closure readiness, blocked states,
monitoring handoff details, and any rollback trigger that the operator should be aware of during
the validation window.

When the `browser-verification` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/browser-verification.instructions.md`: carry browser
verification evidence, human-checkpoint outcomes, and browser-specific post-deploy
checks into the closure artifact instead of treating them as side notes.

When the `strict-safety` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/strict-safety.instructions.md`: carry the risky
`ProposedAction` entries, their `ActionRisk`, approval path, and final
`ActionResult` into closure artifacts when those details matter to rollout,
monitoring, or rollback.

When the `release-observability` capability pack is installed, also follow
`.github/instructions/release-observability.instructions.md`: integrate the
monitoring plan (SLIs, dashboards, alert thresholds), pre-deploy audit results,
post-deploy observation window (owner, duration), and rollback triggers into
the closure artifact as structured sections rather than ad hoc notes.

### Step 1: Gather Closure Context

Collect:

* Summary of the change
* CI status and unresolved review items
* Runtime verification report or validator evidence (required when runtime surfaces were changed) — including verdict (`PASS`, `PASS_WITH_FOLLOW_UP`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`), evidence, manual checkpoint evidence, and follow-up recommendations. If verification was BLOCKED, record the blocked status and the missing prerequisite as a closure condition.
* Any risky actions that required approval, rollback planning, or explicit containment
* Affected runtime surfaces
* Deployment or release path, if applicable
* Invariants that must remain true after release
* Data, migration, or rollout-sensitive behavior that could require extra monitoring

### Step 2: Build the Closure Checklist

The closure artifact MUST include:

* **Invariants to preserve** — the behaviors or guarantees that cannot regress
* **Validator evidence** — the structured summary of probes, manual checkpoints, verdict, and blocked prerequisites received from runtime-verification
* **Pre-deploy audits** — migrations, flags, config, access, or rollout prerequisites that must be checked before release
* **Deployment or rollout path** — merge-only, deploy, canary, phased rollout, maintenance window, or handoff path
* **Post-deploy checks** — the first concrete observations or smoke checks to run after release
* **Risky action record** — the `ProposedAction` entries that materially affected rollout or rollback, their `ActionRisk`, and final `ActionResult`
* **Healthy signals** — what success should look like
* **Failure signals** — what indicates rollback or intervention is needed
* **Monitoring plan** — logs, dashboards, alerts, or smoke checks to watch
* **Rollback trigger** — the condition that should halt or reverse the rollout
* **Rollback procedure** — the actual rollback or mitigation action to take when the trigger fires
* **Validation window** — how long the change should be watched
* **Owner** — who is responsible for observing or acting
* **Compaction status (P-020)** — the post-merge context compaction state, one of `pending`, `done`, or `degraded`. operational-closure initializes this field to `pending` when it creates the closure artifact; the Ship post-merge closure finalizes it to `done` after compact-context completes, or `degraded` if compact-context was invoked but failed (non-blocking). Allowed transitions are `pending` → `done` and `pending` → `degraded` only. The Orchestrator's next-shipment routing (P-001 + P-020) treats `pending`, unset, or missing as an incomplete post-merge closure that blocks routing, and `done` or `degraded` as satisfied.
* **Releasability evidence** — the final structured record showing which required evidence from `runtime_validation.releasability` is satisfied, conditional, or still blocked

### Step 3: Record Readiness Status

Return one of:

* **READY** / `READY` — merge/deploy can proceed with the recorded monitoring plan
* **READY WITH CONDITIONS** / `READY_WITH_CONDITIONS` — proceed only if named conditions are satisfied
* **BLOCKED** / `BLOCKED` — missing verification, unclear rollback path, or unresolved runtime risk

The closure artifact is the canonical releasability evidence record. Do not
collapse validator outcomes back into free-form prose after they have been
structured.

### Step 4: Feed Back into the Harness

When the closure process reveals durable knowledge:

* Invoke `compound` for new runtime, deployment, or workflow learnings
* Update documentation if the release process or architecture knowledge changed
* Add tuning proposals if the harness lacked a needed safety mode, verification pattern, or reviewer

## Why This Skill Exists

Operational closure is the compositional bridge from code production to safe absorption. It makes runtime verification actionable, keeps PRs honest about monitoring expectations, and turns release outcomes into future harness improvements.

## Quality Criteria

* Closure artifacts include concrete release and monitoring signals, not generic advice
* Validator evidence and releasability evidence remain structured rather than turning back into report-oriented runtime notes
* Pre-deploy and post-deploy checks are explicit when the change has runtime or rollout risk
* Risky actions and their outcomes are visible when they affect release safety
* Rollback triggers and rollback procedures are explicit and actionable
* Ownership and validation windows are recorded
* Durable runtime learnings are fed back into the harness when appropriate


## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — closure artifact assembly from defined inputs.
