## File Lock

Manage per-file advisory locks so that multiple agents (or an agent and a
human operator) do not clobber the same file during complex refactors or
parallel work sessions.

## When to Use

Invoke before modifying any source file when concurrent access is possible.
This includes multi-agent orchestration, long-running refactors, and any
session where a human may be editing files in the same workspace.

Agents MUST follow the concurrency protocol defined in
`.github/instructions/concurrency.instructions.md`.

## Inputs

* `filepath`: (Required) Path to the target file, relative to the workspace root.
* `action`: (Required) One of `acquire` or `release`.

## Output

* On `acquire` success: lock file created, exit code 0.
* On `acquire` failure: lock already held by another process, exit code 1.
* On `release` success: lock file removed, exit code 0.
* On `release` failure: lock file not found (already released), exit code 0 with warning.

## Scripts

Both PowerShell and Bash equivalents are provided for cross-platform
compatibility. Use whichever matches the runtime environment.

### acquire_lock (.ps1 / .sh)

Acquires a file lock by creating a `.{filename}.lock` file in the same
directory as the target file. Fails if the lock already exists.

```text
PowerShell: scripts/acquire_lock.ps1 <filepath>
Bash:       scripts/acquire_lock.sh <filepath>
```

The lock file contains:

* Agent or process identifier (`$env:AGENT_NAME` / `$AGENT_NAME` or `"unknown"`)
* Timestamp (ISO 8601)
* PID of the calling process

### release_lock (.ps1 / .sh)

Releases a file lock by deleting the `.{filename}.lock` file.

```text
PowerShell: scripts/release_lock.ps1 <filepath>
Bash:       scripts/release_lock.sh <filepath>
```

## Workflow

```text
1. Agent identifies file to modify
2. Agent runs: scripts/acquire_lock.{ps1|sh} <filepath>
   ├─ Exit 0 → lock acquired, proceed to edit
   └─ Exit 1 → lock held, wait or prompt operator
3. Agent modifies the file
4. Agent verifies the modification (compile, test, etc.)
5. Agent runs: scripts/release_lock.{ps1|sh} <filepath>
```

## Lock Hygiene

* Locks are advisory, not enforced at the filesystem level.
* Lock files MUST NOT be committed to version control.
* Lock files older than 1 hour are likely stale — warn the operator.
* Only the operator may force-break a lock they did not create.
