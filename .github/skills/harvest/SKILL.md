# Harvest Skill

The `harvest` skill turns a reviewed implementation plan into backlog
feature, task, and subtask items. It is the reusable decomposition step
invoked by the stage agent.

This skill does not perform planning or review. It assumes the incoming
plan has already been reviewed or otherwise approved for decomposition.

## Agent-Intercom Communication

When the `agent-intercom` capability pack is installed, call `ping` at
session start. If reachable, broadcast at every step. If unreachable,
warn the operator that visibility is degraded and continue locally.

| Event | Level | Message prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Session start | info | `[HARVEST] Starting: plan={input.plan}` |
| Plan accepted | info | `[HARVEST] Using reviewed plan: {plan_path}` |
| Structure parsed | info | `[HARVEST] Parsed implementation units: {unit_count}` |
| Dry run | info | `[HARVEST] Dry run: {feature_count} features, {task_count} tasks, {subtask_count} subtasks` |
| Feature created | info | `[HARVEST] Created feature: {feature_id} — {title}` |
| Task created | info | `[HARVEST] Created task: {task_id} — {title}` |
| Dependency wired | info | `[HARVEST] Dependency: {item_id} blocked by {depends_on}` |
| Complete | success | `[HARVEST] Complete: {feature_count} features, {task_count} tasks, {subtask_count} subtasks` |

## Inputs

* `${input:plan}`: (Required) Path to the reviewed implementation plan.
* `${input:dry_run:false}`: (Optional, defaults to `false`) Preview the
  planned hierarchy without creating entries.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Validate the reviewed plan

1. Read `${input:plan}` in full.
2. Confirm the file exists and represents an implementation plan.
3. Locate the latest `## Plan Review` section and require literal machine-readable
   markers: `dispatch_mode:` and `decision:`. Missing markers fail closed because
   they may indicate reviewer dispatch was silently skipped.
4. Interpret `decision:`:
   * `decision: PASS` — proceed.
   * `decision: ADVISORY` — proceed only with explicit authorization recorded in
     the harvest invocation or plan review notes; otherwise halt and request the
     operator decision.
   * `decision: FAIL` or any other value — halt; the plan is not harvest-ready.
5. Interpret `dispatch_mode:`. `multi-agent`, `single-agent-declared-degradation`,
   and `same-model-declared-degradation` are acceptable only when the review section
   states that every selected persona was covered. Missing, empty, or unavailable
   dispatch modes halt before backlog creation.
6. Confirm the plan has already cleared the review gate or is explicitly marked ready
   for harvesting according to the markers above.
7. Broadcast the accepted plan path.
8. Halt if the plan is missing, unreadable, lacks review markers, has a FAIL decision,
   has an unauthorized ADVISORY decision, or is clearly not ready for backlog
   creation. Recommend running `plan-review` first when the review state is unclear.

### Phase 2: Parse the plan structure

Extract the planning data needed for decomposition:

1. Root feature title from frontmatter and top-level headings.
2. Problem frame, requirements trace, decisions, and standards check
   for the root feature description.
3. Task candidates from each implementation unit.
4. Subtask candidates from file lists, acceptance criteria, verification
   steps, and test surfaces inside each implementation unit.
5. Dependency edges from the plan's dependency graph.

Use repository search tools to validate file references or symbols when
the plan mentions existing code locations that need confirmation.

### Phase 3: Build the hierarchy model

Map the plan into the backlog hierarchy:

* one feature representing the whole reviewed plan
* one task per implementation unit
* one or more subtasks per file group, verification slice, or explicit
  execution step inside the unit

Before creating anything, apply backlog shaping rules:

1. Keep tasks small enough to fit a focused implementation session
   (the 2-hour rule).
2. Keep each task within a single skill domain.
3. Require a verifiable exit state for every task and subtask.
4. Preserve plan references so downstream execution can trace work
   back to the plan.

**Size + complexity are mandatory, non-conflated, two-axis metadata
(NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Every emitted task-kind work item MUST be assigned both a
`size` value (effort/volume: `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`) and a `complexity`
value (difficulty/uncertainty: `trivial`, `low`, `medium`, `high`). These are
two independent axes, never a single combined scalar. This section is
self-contained — the rules below (structured-emission capability gate, enum
validation gate, two-axis granularity gate, provenance-completeness rule) are
the complete normative contract for this skill and do not depend on any file
outside this template. When the autoharness repository's own
`docs/size-complexity-reference.md` is present in the current workspace (as it
is in the autoharness dogfood repository itself), treat it as supplementary
rationale and worked examples only — it is not copied into every installed
target workspace, so it must never be a required read for following the
rules here.

**Structured-emission capability gate:** Whether `size`/`complexity` are
written as structured backlog fields, and in how many calls, depends on the
active backlog registry — check `features.sizing`, and check exactly which
operation (`create_task` vs. `update_task`) declares the `size`/`complexity`/
`size_source`/`size_ruleset_version` params before assuming support or
call-sequencing:

* When the registry advertises `features.sizing: true` (for example,
  `backlogit`), write `size` and `complexity` as structured fields on every
  task-kind work item, validated per the enum gate below — but do not assume
  they can be set in the same call that creates the task, or even in the
  same call as each other. `backlogit` 1.8.0's `create_task` operation
  (`backlogit_create_item` / `backlogit add`) accepts no sizing params at
  all, and its `update_task` operation enforces two mutually exclusive,
  body-preserving mutation seams: `size` (with `size_source`/
  `size_ruleset_version` together) is one seam, `complexity` is a separate
  seam, and neither can be combined with the other or with any other field
  update in one call. The required sequence for a registry with this shape
  is therefore: (1) create the task with no sizing params, (2) a follow-up
  update call setting `size` (+ `size_source`/`size_ruleset_version` when the
  registry defines those provenance params, set together as one call), (3) a
  further, separate update call setting `complexity`. Always inspect the
  registry's actual `params` declarations per operation before assuming a
  different (or more permissive) sequence is safe.
* When the registry does not advertise `features.sizing` (absent or `false` —
  for example, `backlog-md`, whose `create_task`/`update_task` operations
  expose no structured size/complexity params), the backend has no
  structured slot for these values. Preserve both values anyway by embedding
  them as clearly labeled prose in the task description (for example,
  `Size: M | Complexity: medium`), still enum-validated, and flag this
  degradation explicitly in the harvest report so operators know structured
  provenance is unavailable for this backend. Do not skip assigning size and
  complexity, and do not halt task creation, merely because the backend
  lacks structured fields.

**Enum validation gate (fail-closed):** Validate `size` against
`XS|S|M|L|XL` and `complexity` against `trivial|low|medium|high` before
emitting or writing any work item, whether as structured fields or as
prose-embedded values per the capability gate above. Reject and halt on any
other value rather than silently coercing or defaulting it. This validation
is an extension of the existing P-003 granularity gate below, not a separate
check — a task that fails size/complexity validation is exactly as unready
for staging as one missing an acceptance criterion.

**Two-axis granularity gate (extends the 2-hour rule, P-003):** The 2-hour
rule from shaping rule 1 above is evaluated on BOTH axes independently, never
on size alone, regardless of backend:

* A `size` estimate implying more than 2 hours of human-equivalent effort
  requires splitting the task, regardless of its `complexity`.
* A `complexity: high` task requires de-risking (via further decomposition,
  a spike, or additional deliberation) or an explicit split before being
  emitted as a single executable task — even when its `size` is small. High
  complexity is never a reason to skip the granularity check just because
  the size looks small.

Do not conflate the two axes: never derive `complexity` from `size` (or vice
versa), and never emit a single blended difficulty/effort scalar in place of
the two distinct fields.

**Parent-first ordering (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Tasks require a `parent_id`
referencing an existing feature. The root feature MUST be created before any
tasks are created. If the harvest context does not include an existing parent
feature for task-kind work items, create or identify one before proceeding.
Omitting `parent_id` for task-kind artifacts violates the required
parent-child hierarchy (P-003 decomposition integrity) and may be blocked by
the configured backlog registry or policy gates.

When the `backlogit` capability pack is installed and the registry advertises
`features.shipments: true`, the parent feature MUST be added to the shipment
before its child tasks during shipment assembly. This ordering is enforced
downstream by the Ship agent — flag it explicitly in the harvest report so
Ship can assemble the shipment correctly.

### Phase 4: Execute or preview

If `${input:dry_run}` is `true`:

1. Produce the proposed feature, task, subtask, and dependency structure,
   including the proposed `size` and `complexity` value for every task.
2. Broadcast the dry-run counts.
3. Do not call backlog mutation tools.

If `${input:dry_run}` is `false`:

1. Query the backlog first to avoid duplicate root features.
   Use `backlogit_list_items` or `backlogit_search_items` to check for existing
   items with matching titles.
2. Create the root feature via `backlogit_create_item` or
   `backlogit add --type {{artifact_type}} --title {{title}}`.
3. Create one task per implementation unit under that feature via
   `backlogit_create_item`/`backlogit add --type {{artifact_type}} --title {{title}}` (`create_task`). Then set `size`
   and `complexity` per the structured-emission capability gate above: when
   `features.sizing: true`, apply them as one or more follow-up
   `backlogit_update_item`/`backlogit update {{id}}` (`update_task`) calls in whatever
   number and order the registry's declared `params` require (for example,
   `backlogit` requires a separate call for `size`/`size_source`/
   `size_ruleset_version` and another separate call for `complexity`); when
   `features.sizing` is absent or `false`, embed both values as prose in the
   description at creation time instead. Validate both values per the enum
   validation gate above before any write, structured or prose.
4. Create granular subtasks under each task.
5. Wire dependencies when the backlog tool supports dependency operations
   (check the backlog registry for availability).
6. Broadcast each created feature, task, and dependency edge as it is
   written.

### Phase 5: Verify and report

1. Confirm the created hierarchy through backlog read operations.
2. Report the created IDs, counts, and dependency summary.
3. Return the ready backlog as the output of the planning pipeline.
4. Recommend handing the resulting backlog to the build-and-ship
   workflow for harness, build, review, CI, and pull request execution.

## Guardrails

* Do not modify the plan file.
* Do not skip duplicate checks.
* Do not create shipment artifacts from this skill. Shipment assembly
  happens downstream in Stage (Step 5.5) or Ship (fallback path).
* Keep descriptions self-contained enough for the next executor to act
  without reopening the plan for basic context.
* Never emit a task without both `size` and `complexity` set and enum-validated.
* Never combine `size` and `complexity` into one field or derive one axis from
  the other. This rule is fully stated above and does not require any external
  file to be present in the installed workspace.

## Model Routing

This skill operates at **Tier 2 (Standard)** — backlog decomposition is structured and deterministic.
