# Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Safety-First Go

All production code MUST be written in Go (1.21+).
Prefer standard-library concurrency and avoid unsafe or panic-driven control flow in library code.. golangci-lint warnings are treated as real defects.. Return explicit errors, wrap them with context, and prefer errors.Is/errors.As friendly patterns..

**Rationale**: Explicit error handling and safety enforcement prevent data corruption,
silent failures, and state loss during unattended agent operation.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every feature or chore MUST have tests written before implementation code. The test
directory structure (Primary tests live in inline (_test.go).) MUST be maintained. All tests MUST
pass via `go test ./...` before any code is merged. Steps: write test,
confirm it fails (red), implement, confirm it passes (green). Never write
production code before the corresponding test exists and has been observed
to fail.

**Rationale**: Agents operating unattended for extended periods cannot
self-verify correctness without a robust test suite. Regressions caught
in production are orders of magnitude more expensive than regressions
caught by a failing test.

### III. Workspace Isolation and Security Boundaries

All file-system operations MUST resolve within the configured workspace root.
Path traversal attempts MUST be rejected. No secrets or credentials MUST
appear in committed files.

**Rationale**: Agents run with the operator's filesystem permissions. Without
strict isolation, a misbehaving agent could access or corrupt unrelated
projects, leak internal paths, or expose sensitive information.

### IV. CLI Workspace Containment (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

When an agent operates in CLI mode, it MUST NOT create, modify, or delete any
file or directory outside the current working directory tree. This applies to
all file operations. Paths that resolve above or outside the cwd, whether via
absolute paths, `..` traversal, symlinks, or environment variable expansion,
MUST be refused. The only exception is reading files explicitly provided by
the user as context.

**Rationale**: CLI agents run with the operator's full filesystem permissions
and no interactive approval UI. A single misrouted write can corrupt unrelated
repositories, overwrite system configuration, or destroy data in sibling
directories.

### V. Structured Observability

All significant operations MUST produce traceable output. Agent actions MUST
be logged through broadcasting, commit messages, or structured reporting.
Coverage MUST include: build/test execution, file modifications, quality
gate results, and error conditions.

**Rationale**: Agents run as background services for extended periods. When
something goes wrong during unattended operation, structured traces are the
primary diagnostic tool.

### VI. Single Responsibility

New dependencies MUST be justified by a concrete requirement. Do not add
libraries or tools speculatively. Prefer the standard library and existing
project dependencies over external additions. Optional capabilities SHOULD
use feature flags or conditional configuration.

**Rationale**: Every additional dependency increases build time, attack
surface, and maintenance burden. Agents should minimize the changes they
introduce to the dependency graph.

### VII. Destructive Command Approval (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All destructive terminal commands MUST require operator approval before
execution, regardless of permissive agent modes. A terminal command is
destructive if it: deletes files or directories, overwrites files without
backup, modifies system configuration, alters version control history,
drops or truncates data, installs or removes system-level packages, or
executes code from untrusted sources.

**Rationale**: Permissive agent modes exist to reduce friction for routine
operations. They must never extend to destructive operations because a
single misrouted destructive command can irrecoverably corrupt repositories
or break system configuration.

### VIII. Explicit Safety Modes for Elevated Risk

When work involves destructive commands, production-impacting changes, uncertain root causes,
or large blast radius, agents MUST switch into an explicit safety mode before proceeding:

* **Careful mode** — enumerate risks, confirm intent, and pause before high-impact operations
* **Freeze-scope mode** — constrain work to a declared path or subsystem boundary
* **Investigate-first mode** — gather evidence and causal understanding before proposing fixes

**Rationale**: Guardrails are more reliable when they are interactive and legible. Safety modes
translate policy into an operating posture that both the agent and the operator can reason about.

### Capability Overlay — agent-intercom

When the workspace enables the `agent-intercom` capability pack, agents MUST use the configured
intercom workflow for heartbeat, milestone broadcasting, destructive-operation approval routing,
and operator steering waits. If the intercom path becomes unavailable, agents MUST warn that
remote visibility is degraded and must not silently bypass approval steps that depend on it.

**Rationale**: A remote operator cannot supervise or approve work they cannot see. When intercom
is part of the harness, observability and approval routing become operational requirements rather
than optional niceties.

### Capability Overlay — agent-engram

When the workspace enables the `agent-engram` capability pack, agents MUST use the configured
engram workflow for indexed search, workspace binding and status checks, code-graph traversal,
and freshness verification. Agents MUST prefer engram MCP tools over file-based search for
context-related discovery, MUST refresh or verify stale index state before trusting query results,
and MUST not hand-edit tool-managed `.engram/` artifacts as a substitute for lifecycle or sync
operations.

**Rationale**: Engram exists to compress codebase understanding into a queryable local index.
Ignoring that index and falling back immediately to raw file reading wastes context budget and
throws away the leverage the overlay was meant to provide.

### Capability Overlay — backlogit

When the workspace enables the `backlogit` capability pack, agents MUST use the configured
backlogit workflow for queue selection, dependency management, token-efficient task lookup,
continuity checkpoints, and task traceability. Agents MUST prefer backlogit query and queue
operations over manual backlog scanning when those operations are available, MUST refresh the
index after out-of-band edits before trusting query output, and MUST not bypass backlogit by
creating parallel task state outside the configured backlog workspace.

**Rationale**: backlogit exists to preserve agent context through targeted queries, explicit work
ordering, and durable execution traces. Treating it as a thin file store would discard the very
capabilities that justify enabling the overlay.

### Capability Overlay — graphtor-docs

When the workspace enables the `graphtor-docs` capability pack, agents MUST use the configured
graphtor-docs workflow for indexed local documentation search, semantic retrieval, doc-link
traversal, and source-index status checks. Agents MUST prefer graphtor-docs indexed retrieval over
broad web search or raw filesystem scanning for conceptual, API-oriented, or documentation
questions, MUST verify server reachability and index freshness before trusting results, and MUST
not hand-edit tool-managed `.graphtor/` artifacts as a substitute for re-indexing or configuration
updates.

**Rationale**: graphtor-docs exists to resolve domain concepts and referenced APIs from an indexed
local documentation corpus. Defaulting immediately to broad web search or raw file scanning wastes
context budget and discards the retrieval leverage the overlay was meant to provide.

### IX. Git-Friendly Persistence

All workspace state managed by the agent harness MUST be serializable to
human-readable, Git-mergeable files. Markdown with YAML frontmatter is the
preferred format for structured documents. Writes SHOULD use atomic
operations to prevent corruption. File formats SHOULD minimize merge
conflicts through sorted keys and stable ordering.

**Rationale**: Workspace state travels with the codebase in Git.
Human-readable files enable code review of agent-managed state, conflict
resolution during merges, and manual editing when needed.

### X. Agent Context Efficiency

Tools and data access patterns MUST preserve agent context windows by
returning minimal, targeted data. When a structured query can replace
directory scanning or bulk file reading, agents MUST prefer the query.
Tool responses MUST be structured (JSON or YAML), not raw file content,
unless the agent explicitly needs the full document.

**Rationale**: AI agents operate within finite context windows. Every
token consumed by bulk data is a token unavailable for reasoning and
code generation. Data access architecture should serve token-efficient
query results to agents.

### XI. Merge Commit History Preservation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All pull request merges MUST use merge commits. Squash merge and rebase
merge are expressly forbidden. Repository settings MUST be configured to
disable squash and rebase merge options (GitHub Settings → General →
Pull Requests → uncheck "Allow squash merging" and "Allow rebase merging").
The ship agent MUST verify the merge strategy before executing any merge
and MUST halt with a P-009 violation if squash or rebase merge is detected.

**Rationale**: Merge commits preserve the full development history,
individual commit attribution, and bisect-friendly history. Squash merge
destroys commit granularity and makes root-cause analysis of regressions
significantly harder. Rebase merge rewrites history, breaking
commit-traceability links and backlog commit associations.

## Technical Constraints

| Concern         | Constraint                                                       |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Language        | Go 1.21+                        |
| Build           | `go build ./...`                                              |
| Test            | `go test ./...`                                               |
| Lint            | `go vet ./...`                                               |
| Format          | `gofmt -l -w .`                                             |

| Error Handling  | error return + errors.Is/errors.As                                                |
| Documentation   | // GoDoc comment                                            |

## Quality Gates

Run in order. Do not skip any gate.

```text
gofmt -l . (no output) and `gofmt -w .` applied
go vet ./... passes with no findings
go test ./... (and `go test -race ./...` for concurrent code) passes
go build ./... compiles cleanly
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Harness before code**: Every feature or chore MUST have a compiling but failing
   test harness before implementation begins.
2. **Backlog-driven planning**: All task tracking MUST use the backlog system.
   Static markdown task lists outside `.backlogit/` are not permitted.
3. **Single active implementation branch/worktree**: Each feature or chore MUST be
   developed on one dedicated implementation branch in one active worktree. Agents
   MUST NOT split implementation, backlog execution, PR preparation, or closure
   across parallel branches or worktrees. The only exception is an explicit
   Stage-owned, time-boxed spike/research worktree used for staging investigation;
   that worktree MUST NOT perform implementation, template/source/config mutation,
   shipment claim, PR preparation, or Ship execution.
4. **Commit discipline**: Each commit MUST be coherent and buildable. Commit
   messages follow conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`).
5. **No dead code**: Placeholder modules MUST be replaced or removed before a
   release unit is considered complete.
6. **Operational closure**: Work is not complete at “green CI” if runtime validation,
   monitoring setup, or release handoff remains unresolved. Required post-merge context
   compaction (**P-020**) is part of the mandatory closure set: Ship MUST invoke the
   compact-context skill at every post-merge closure.

### Task Granularity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Agent reliability drops below 50% for tasks exceeding 2 hours of human-equivalent
effort and approaches 0% beyond 4 hours. All task decomposition enforces these rules:

* **2-Hour Rule**: Every task MUST be scoped to roughly 2 hours of human effort.
  Heuristics: fewer than 3 files modified, fewer than 5 functions changed, fewer
  than 4 test scenarios.
* **Width Isolation**: Each task MUST target a single skill domain. Do not combine
  code with documentation, schema changes with API handlers, or test
  infrastructure with production code in the same task.
* **Atomic Milestone**: Every task MUST produce a verifiable state change: a passing
  test, a successful build, or a measurable output.

### Stop Conditions and Circuit Breakers

The full circuit breaker protocol — retry thresholds, escalation steps, stall
detection, and error logging — is defined in `circuit-breaker.instructions.md`.
All agents MUST follow that protocol. The summary table below is a quick
reference; the instruction file is authoritative.

| Counter                         | Limit | Action                                              |
|---------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Consecutive operation failures  | 3     | Stop, log to `docs/memory/`, prompt user        |
| Skill-managed loop (build/fix-ci)| 5    | Skill limit governs inside loop scope               |
| Same-error recurrence in loop   | 3     | Universal breaker overrides: stop, log, prompt      |
| Tasks attempted in session      | 20    | Halt, write memory checkpoint, exit                 |
| Consecutive task failures       | 3     | Halt, prompt operator for guidance                  |
| Review-fix cycles per task      | 3     | Accept remaining as backlog items, commit, move on  |
| Total fix-ci cycles             | 5     | Halt, leave PR open for manual intervention         |
| Session stalls                  | 3     | Halt, write checkpoint, prompt operator             |

### Model Routing

| Tier                    | Model Class  | Agents                                         | Rationale                       |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Tier 1 (Fast/Cheap)** | Smaller model | prompt-builder, learnings-researcher          | Low-complexity tasks            |
| **Tier 2 (Standard)**  | Medium model | ship, go-engineer, harness-architect | Routine code, scaffolding, coordination |
| **Tier 3 (Frontier)**  | Large model  | stage                                          | Deep analysis and architecture  |

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices in this
workspace. All code reviews and automated checks MUST verify compliance
with these principles.

### Enforcement Language

| Level | Meaning | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **NON-NEGOTIABLE** | Agent MUST comply. Violations trigger P-005 telemetry and halt. | CI gates, policy checks, or runtime containment |
| **MUST** | Agent MUST comply. Violations are flagged; self-correction is expected. | Agent workflow logic, review findings |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended practice. Deviations are acceptable with documented rationale. | Advisory review findings |
| **MAY** | Optional practice at agent discretion. | — |

### Enforcement Model

| Principle | Level | Enforcement Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| I. Safety-First Language | MUST | CI quality gates (`go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`) |
| II. Test-First Development | NON-NEGOTIABLE | P-002/P-004 policies; harness-architect red phase; build-feature green phase |
| III. Workspace Isolation | MUST | Agent runtime path resolution within workspace root |
| IV. CLI Containment | NON-NEGOTIABLE | Agent runtime cwd boundary enforcement |
| V. Structured Observability | MUST | Broadcasting, commit messages, structured reporting; P-020 post-merge compaction closure gate |
| VI. Single Responsibility | SHOULD | Code review persona checks on dependency additions |
| VII. Destructive Approval | NON-NEGOTIABLE | P-005 violation telemetry; strict-safety enforcement when enabled |
| VIII. Safety Modes | MUST | safety-modes skill invocation; strict-safety decision gate when enabled |
| IX. Git-Friendly Persistence | SHOULD | Markdown + YAML frontmatter convention |
| X. Context Efficiency | SHOULD | Query-first data access patterns |

For principles marked NON-NEGOTIABLE without runtime enforcement (II, IV),
agents that observe violations MUST broadcast a P-005 event and halt rather
than proceeding.

- **Amendments**: Any change to this constitution MUST be documented
  with a version bump, rationale, and sync impact report. Principle
  removals or redefinitions require a MAJOR version bump. New principles
  or material expansions require MINOR. Clarifications and wording fixes
  require PATCH.
- **Compliance review**: Every implementation plan MUST include a
  "Constitution Check" section that maps the proposed work against these
  principles and documents any justified violations.
- **Conflict resolution**: When a principle conflicts with a practical
  implementation need, the conflict MUST be documented with the specific
  principle violated, the justification, and the simpler alternative that
  was rejected.
