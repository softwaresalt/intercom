# CI Security Instructions

These instructions define required security conventions and structural
expectations for CI/CD workflows. All workflow files matching
`**/.github/workflows/*.yml` MUST comply with these rules.

## Dependency Pinning

All third-party CI actions or reusable steps MUST be pinned to an
immutable reference (full commit SHA for GitHub Actions, digest for
container images). Mutable version tags MUST NOT be used as the sole
reference. A semantic version MAY be included as a trailing comment
for readability.

**Required pattern (GitHub Actions):**

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@<full-sha> # v4.2.2
```

**Forbidden patterns:**

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v4
uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2
```

Local reusable workflows referenced via relative paths are excluded
from SHA pinning requirements.

## Permissions

Workflows MUST declare explicit permissions following the principle of
least privilege. The default permission set is `contents: read`.
Additional permissions MUST be granted at the job level and only when
required for a specific capability.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

Job-level additions:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      deployments: write
```

## Credentials and Secrets

Workflows MUST NOT persist credentials by default. Credential
persistence MUST be enabled only when explicitly required. Secrets
and tokens MUST be scoped to the minimum required permissions.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@<full-sha> # v4.2.2
  with:
    persist-credentials: false
```

## Workflow Structure

Workflows MUST follow these structural expectations:

* Use descriptive names for workflows and jobs.
* Group related jobs with dependency declarations.
* Use concurrency controls to prevent duplicate runs when the CI
  platform supports them.
* Prefer reusable or composite workflows for common patterns.

## Reusable Workflows

When defining reusable workflows, use explicit typed inputs and outputs.
Consuming workflows reference reusable definitions by relative path or
SHA-pinned repository reference.

## Runner Selection

Workflows SHOULD run on the default hosted runner tier for the CI
platform unless a specific capability requires a different runner type.
Self-hosted runners require additional hardening considerations:

* Avoid persisting state between runs.
* Pin tool versions explicitly rather than relying on pre-installed
  tooling.
* Apply network and access controls appropriate to the environment.
