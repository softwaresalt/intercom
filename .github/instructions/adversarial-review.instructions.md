# Adversarial Review Instructions

Use these rules when the workspace has enabled the `adversarial-review`
capability pack. This pack provides multi-model parallel review for higher
review confidence on security-sensitive, compliance-critical, or large-scale
code changes. It also supports a first-class Anchor Reviewer route and alternate model providers
(e.g., Gemini) so reviewer diversity is not limited to the standard tier routing set.

## When to Escalate

Escalate from standard code review to adversarial review when:

* the standard review skill surfaces 3 or more P0/P1 findings
* the workspace is security-sensitive and the diff touches auth, crypto,
  data processing, or PII handling
* the operator explicitly requests multi-model validation

## Multi-Model Dispatch Protocol

The adversarial-review agent dispatches multiple independent reviewer
instances across different model tiers:

* use at least 3 parallel reviewers when available
* prefer cross-model diversity: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 reviewers
* each reviewer operates independently and does not see other reviewers'
  findings until consensus assembly

## Anchor Reviewer Support

When `openai` and `gpt-5.6-sol` are configured,
launch an **Anchor Reviewer** as a separately identified reviewer slot before
standard Tier 1/2/3 assignment. Pass `high` to the
anchor reviewer when it is non-empty; an empty value means use the model default.
The default anchor route is OpenAI GPT-5.6 Sol, but generated artifacts stay
environment-agnostic by using the configured provider and family identifiers
rather than hard-coding a runtime.

If the anchor route is unavailable, record `TOOL_DEGRADED: anchor-review-model`
with a declared fallback and continue only when the remaining reviewer pool still
meets the minimum reviewer count and consensus rules. Never silently drop the
Anchor Reviewer from the report.

## Alternate Model Provider Support

When `` and `` are configured,
one reviewer slot (Reviewer-B, the Tier 2 slot by default) is reassigned to
the alternate provider and family. This allows a Gemini model, a different
Anthropic family, or any registered provider to participate in the reviewer
pool without requiring additional reviewer count.

**Escalation path**: If the standard tier routing set produces repeated
disagreements (no consensus after 3 invocations on the same change), consider
enabling the alternate provider to break the deadlock with a genuinely
different perspective.

**Provider failure handling**: If the alternate provider is unreachable or
returns an error, fall back to the Tier 2 standard model for that reviewer
slot. Log the fallback. Do not halt the review.

## Post-Remediation Re-Review

After `safe_auto` fixes are applied from the remediation plan, the
adversarial-review agent re-dispatches the same reviewer pool over the fixed
files to verify no new issues were introduced. This prevents a targeted fix
from inadvertently breaking a related invariant.

**Recursion rules**:

* Maximum 2 re-review cycles per invocation.
* Re-review scope is limited to files modified by `safe_auto` fixes only —
  not the full original scope.
* If the cap is reached and findings remain, they are recorded as
  `post_remediation_residual` in the output report. No further fixes are
  applied automatically.
* The recursion cap is a hard limit. The agent MUST NOT recurse more than
  twice, regardless of the number or severity of residual findings.
* `post_remediation_review: false` disables the re-review phase entirely for
  callers that manage their own fix-verify loop.

**Cap reached with residual findings**: When 2 cycles complete and residual
findings remain, the output report records them as follow-up backlog items
with `post_remediation_residual: true`. The operator should review these
before merge.

## Consensus Assembly

After all reviewers return findings:

* **HIGH confidence / Consensus section** — finding identified by all reviewers.
  Treat identically to a standard review P0/P1 finding: blocks the gate.
* **MEDIUM confidence / Majority section** — finding identified by a strict
  majority of reviewers (`agreement_count > reviewers / 2`). Requires explicit
  acknowledgment (fix or defer with rationale).
* **MEDIUM confidence / Plurality section** — finding identified by more than one
  reviewer but not by a strict majority, such as 2 of 4 reviewers. Requires
  explicit acknowledgment and uses the same action-class rules as other MEDIUM
  findings.
* **LOW confidence / Unique section** — finding identified by a single reviewer
  only. Preserved as an advisory observation.

## Remediation Queue

Assemble findings into a structured remediation queue ordered by
`confidence × severity`:

* each entry includes: finding summary, affected file/line, report section,
  confidence tier, severity (P0–P3), and action class (safe_auto / gated_auto /
  manual / advisory)
* HIGH-confidence P0/P1 entries are ready for direct backlog creation
* remediation entries carry enough context to be actionable without
  re-reading the full diff

## Integration with Standard Review

Adversarial review does not replace standard review — it supplements it
when escalation criteria are met. The ship agent should:

* run standard review first
* escalate to adversarial review when the threshold is reached
* merge adversarial findings into the standard review report
