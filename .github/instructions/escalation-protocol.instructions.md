# Escalation Protocol Instructions

This instruction is installed whenever `_stage.agent.md` **or** `_ship.agent.md`
is present in the workspace (either-agent condition — distinct from the
two-agent-only `role-enforcement.instructions.md` gate). It defines the
**escalation-payload contract** that a halting agent compiles when a
consecutive-failure threshold is crossed, and the single canonical definition of
`ESCALATION_DEGRADED` referenced by both agent templates so the term is defined
once and never drifts between them.

## Status: Protocol Contract Active Now; Runtime Telemetry Substrate External (P-013.6)

This document defines the **auto-escalation protocol contract** — the payload
shape, the routing resolution rule, and the degraded-state fallback. The
**agent-directed steps are active now**: when an installed `_stage.agent.md`
or `_ship.agent.md` crosses its own already-existing, agent-observed
consecutive-failure/iteration threshold (each pipeline agent's own Stop
Conditions table — no new runtime component is required for the agent itself
to follow this directive), the halting agent compiles the escalation payload,
resolves the escalation route, applies the same-route guard, hands the payload
off for analysis, and halts without executing the failed operation again. This
is a real, present-tense behavior change to each agent's own stop-condition
handling, not a future one.

What remains **external and dormant** (routed OUT, per the 106-F plan) is
narrower than "the whole protocol": specifically, (a) a standing, independent
**runtime telemetry event emitter/sink/queryable store** that autonomously
records events outside the acting agent's own reasoning loop, and (b) an
**automated, non-agent threshold-evaluation engine** that would watch that
telemetry substrate and fire escalation without any acting agent participating
in the decision. Until that substrate exists, `evidence_path` /
`artifact_refs` in the payload contract below are best-effort references (or
absent, when telemetry is disabled) rather than guaranteed pointers into a
live event store; the protocol does not depend on that substrate to function
today. Operators must not be misled into believing a machine independently
monitors and fires this protocol — it is always the acting agent, following
its own already-tracked failure counters, that compiles the payload and
resolves the route.

## Authority-Preservation Invariant (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Escalation under this protocol is a **reasoning escalation** — a request for
analysis of the failed unit of work by a stronger/deeper reasoning model — and
is **never an authority escalation**. Compiling an escalation payload, resolving
an escalation route, or handing off to engram MUST NOT, by itself:

* authorize a shipment claim or task claim,
* authorize a merge or admin-fallback merge,
* authorize a source, template, schema, or backlog mutation beyond what the
  invoking agent's own Role Boundary already permits,
* bypass P-001 (release-unit sequencing), P-009 (merge-commit-only), P-014
  (local review readiness), P-017 (dark factory contract), or P-020 (post-merge
  compaction).

The terminal state of an escalation is a **halt + engram handoff** for
operator/asynchronous review. The handoff is for asynchronous or operator
review, not a fourth attempt. It is never a silent, unsupervised expansion of
what the halting agent is allowed to do.

## Escalation-Payload Contract

When a halting agent crosses its consecutive-failure threshold (see the
invoking agent's own Stop Conditions table), it MUST compile an escalation
payload containing the following fields before handing off and halting:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `threshold_kind` | The stop-condition category that triggered escalation (e.g., `build_fix_attempts`, `consecutive_task_failures`, `review_fix_cycles`, `fix_ci_cycles`). |
| `threshold_count` | The observed count that crossed the configured limit for `threshold_kind`. |
| `failure_summary` | A concise, human-readable summary of what failed and the immediate suspected cause(s). |
| `last_n_action_refs` | References (tool-call identifiers, commit SHAs, or log offsets) to the last N actions attempted, so a reviewer or handoff analyst can reconstruct recent history without replaying it blind. |
| `last_n_observation_refs` | References to the last N observed results (build/test output, review findings, CI check results) corresponding to `last_n_action_refs`. |
| `artifact_refs` | Paths or identifiers of artifacts touched by the failing unit of work (files, backlog item IDs, PR number). Field name aligns with `schemas/tool-telemetry-event.schema.json#artifact_refs` so escalation payloads and tool telemetry events can be cross-referenced. |
| `evidence_path` | Path to any structured telemetry evidence backing the failure (when telemetry is enabled), aligned with `schemas/tool-telemetry-event.schema.json#evidence_path`. Absent/empty when telemetry is disabled — this is not itself a failure condition. |
| `resumption_checkpoint_ref` | A reference (checkpoint filename, memory doc path, or backlog comment) that lets the resolved escalation route (or the operator) resume the unit of work without losing state. |
| `resolved_escalation_route` | The `(model_family, model_provider, reasoning_effort)` tuple actually resolved for this handoff, per the Escalation Route Resolution section below. Recorded here — not merely resolved in-memory — so a handoff consumer has a contract-defined route on which to run the promised independent analysis without re-deriving the resolution precedence itself. Present only when the resolution is not `ESCALATION_DEGRADED` (see below); a degraded route is never recorded in this field. |

## Escalation Route Resolution (P-013.6 / F02FD596 nested per-role hierarchy)

The escalation route resolves via a role-scoped precedence:

1. **Nested per-role override**: `model_routing.<role>.escalation`
   (`stage.escalation` or `ship.escalation`, matching the acting agent's own
   role). When declared, the acting role resolves its escalation route from
   this nested block. A nested override that declares only some fields falls
   back **per field** to `model_routing.tier3` for the missing fields —
   **never** to the legacy flat route below; an explicit nested override
   never silently defers to the shared legacy route.
2. **Legacy flat fallback (DEPRECATED)**: when the acting role has no nested
   `escalation` override, `model_routing.escalation`
   (`claude-opus-5` / `` / ``
   — the pre-F02FD596 flat, role-agnostic route) resolves instead, with a
   deprecation notice. This is retained, unremoved, for backward
   compatibility. Whether this fallback is actually active for the acting
   role in this installed workspace depends on whether a nested override is
   declared for that role — check `model_routing.<role>.escalation` at
   session-start reload time (H6) rather than assuming either shape from this
   static instruction text, which describes the general precedence rule for
   any workspace, not a fixed installed fact about this one.
3. **Tier3 fallback**: any field still unresolved after (1)/(2) falls back
   per-field to `model_routing.tier3`
   (`claude-opus-5` / `` / ``).

This mirrors the P-013.5 `stage`/`ship` role-route fallback pattern: a
targeted override, never a parallel tier taxonomy.

**Both-present fail-closed (H2)**: the legacy flat `model_routing.escalation`
and any nested `<role>.escalation` (for either role) MUST NOT both declare a
non-empty field. When both are present, resolution is **AMBIGUOUS** and MUST
fail closed — a schema-level constraint rejects this shape where expressible,
and the loader/verification layer enforces the same rule as a backstop.
Never auto-pick a winner; migrate fully to nested per-role escalation, or
remove the nested override(s), to resolve the ambiguity.


## `ESCALATION_DEGRADED` (canonical definition — defined once, referenced elsewhere)

`ESCALATION_DEGRADED` is declared when **any** of the following hold:

1. **Route unavailable.** The resolved escalation route cannot be dispatched by
   the runtime (the model/provider is not available in this environment).
2. **Engram unavailable.** The terminal engram handoff surface cannot be reached
   (no MCP tool, no file-based fallback capable of receiving the handoff).
3. **Same-route no-op (role-scoped, H3).** The fully-resolved escalation
   tuple `(model_family, model_provider, reasoning_effort)` for the ACTING
   role's own effective escalation route (nested `<role>.escalation` if
   declared, else legacy flat, else tier3 fallback) equals that SAME acting
   role's own already-resolved role route tuple (P-013.5) for this session —
   compared only against the acting role's own route, never a different
   role's route. For example, an agent whose role route is already pinned to
   `tier3` receiving an unset `escalation` route that also falls back to
   `tier3` would "escalate" to an identical model, which is not a real
   escalation.

When `ESCALATION_DEGRADED` is declared, the halting agent MUST fall back to its
existing **operator-halt** path (the Stop Conditions escalation prompt already
defined in its own agent template) rather than proceeding as though escalation
succeeded. `_stage.agent.md` and `_ship.agent.md` both reference this single
definition rather than re-declaring it, preventing drift between the two
templates.

## Terminal Engram Handoff

When the resolved route is available and not degraded, the halting agent
records the route in the payload's `resolved_escalation_route` field, hands
the compiled payload to engram for asynchronous or operator review, and
halts. It MUST NOT re-execute the failing
operation after its circuit is open. The handoff is for asynchronous or
operator review, not a fourth attempt. This handoff is
informational/diagnostic — it carries no authority of its own (see the
Authority-Preservation Invariant above).

## Relationship to Other Policies

* **P-013 / P-013.5**: This protocol extends the existing tier-escalation and
  invocation-time routing enforcement machinery; it does not replace either.
* **P-001 / P-009 / P-014 / P-017 / P-020**: Explicitly preserved — see the
  Authority-Preservation Invariant.
* **P-006 (Plan Hardening)**: Same-route degradation and dormant-until-runtime
  status are documented failure modes for any plan extending this protocol.
