# Adversarial Review

Run multiple independent reviewer agents in parallel, each using a different model,
and assemble their findings into a consensus report. Agreement across models signals
high-confidence findings; unique findings from a single model are preserved as
low-confidence observations worth human attention. The result is a structured
remediation queue with findings ordered by confidence × severity.

After auto-fixes are applied, a post-remediation re-review phase re-dispatches the
same reviewer pool over the fixed files to verify no new issues were introduced.
Recursion is capped at 2 cycles to prevent infinite loops.

## Why Adversarial

Different models have different blind spots. A finding that appears in all reviewer
outputs is almost certainly real. A finding that appears in only one model's output
may be a false positive — or a subtle issue that only one model caught. The protocol
preserves both signals with appropriate confidence labels, rather than losing unique
findings or trusting any single model too much.

Anchor Reviewer support (`openai` / `gpt-5.6-sol`)
adds a first-class reviewer route, defaulting to OpenAI GPT-5.6 Sol where supported,
without replacing Tier 1/2/3 diversity. If the anchor route cannot be dispatched,
record a declared fallback and continue only when the remaining reviewer pool still
satisfies the consensus minimum.

Alternate model provider support (`` / ``)
allows reviewer slots to be assigned to Gemini or other providers outside the standard
tier routing set, ensuring reviewer diversity is not limited to a single provider's
model family.

## When to Use

* Pre-merge review for high-risk changes (architecture, security, data integrity)
* Periodic sweep of a module that has accumulated significant churn
* Validating a set of automated fixes before applying them
* Any review where a single-model review felt insufficient or inconclusive

## Inputs

* `files`: (Required) Files or diff to review. Can be a list of paths, a git diff
  ref (e.g., `HEAD~1`), or a PR number.
* `reviewers`: (Optional) Total number of parallel reviewer instances, including
  the Anchor Reviewer when the anchor route is dispatchable. Default: 4 with a
  dispatchable anchor route (Anchor + Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3), otherwise 3
  (Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3). Minimum: 2 (a single reviewer provides no
  consensus signal). Maximum: 5.
* `models`: (Optional) Model tiers/routes to use for each reviewer instance.
  Specify a list matching the `reviewers` count, including `anchor_review` when
  assigning an Anchor Reviewer slot. When unset, use the count-specific mapping
  in Phase 1 so every accepted reviewer count has a deterministic slot map.
* `alt_provider`: (Optional) Alternate model provider name (e.g., `google`).
  Overrides `` for this invocation. When set, one reviewer
  slot is assigned to the alternate provider.
* `alt_family`: (Optional) Alternate model family (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`).
  Overrides `` for this invocation. Paired with `alt_provider`.
* `anchor_provider`: (Optional) Anchor reviewer provider. Overrides
  `openai` for this invocation.
* `anchor_family`: (Optional) Anchor reviewer model family. Overrides
  `gpt-5.6-sol` for this invocation.
* `anchor_reasoning_effort`: (Optional) Anchor reviewer reasoning effort.
  Overrides `high`; empty means use the model
  default.
* `ruleset`: (Optional) Path to a ruleset file. Defaults to
  `.github/copilot-review-instructions.md` if present, otherwise uses the
  built-in harness review ruleset.
* `output_mode`: (Optional) `consensus-only` (return only high-confidence findings)
  or `full` (default — return consensus + majority + unique with confidence labels).
* `post_remediation_review`: (Optional, default `true`) Whether to run the
  post-remediation re-review phase (Phase 7) after auto-fixes are applied. Set
  to `false` to disable re-review and exit after the remediation plan.

## Output

1. **Consensus findings** (confidence: HIGH) — Flagged by all `reviewers` agents.
   These require mandatory remediation before merge.
2. **Majority findings** (confidence: MEDIUM) — Flagged by more than half of agents.
   Require explicit acknowledgment (fix or defer with rationale).
3. **Plurality findings** (confidence: MEDIUM) — Flagged by more than one reviewer
   but not by a strict majority, such as 2 of 4 reviewers. These are not consensus,
   but they are stronger than unique observations and require explicit
   acknowledgment.
4. **Unique findings** (confidence: LOW) — Flagged by exactly one agent.
   Preserved as observations; human judgment required on whether to act.
5. **Remediation plan** — Ordered action list combining all findings, sorted by
   `confidence × severity`, with estimated action class (`safe_auto`, `gated_auto`,
   `manual`, `advisory`).
6. **Bug/issue queue entries** — For each P0 and P1 finding, a structured work item
   ready to create in the backlog using `backlogit add --type {{artifact_type}} --title {{title}}`.

## Required Protocol

### Phase 1: Prepare

1. Resolve the file list or diff to review.
2. Load the ruleset from the specified path or the default.
3. Determine the reviewer count and model route assignment. The `reviewers`
   value is the total number of slots; when the anchor route is dispatchable, the
   Anchor Reviewer consumes one slot. Use these mappings unless `models` provides
   an explicit list with the same count:

   | Reviewer count | Anchor dispatchable mapping | Anchor unavailable mapping |
   |---|---|---|
   | 2 | Anchor Reviewer + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) | Reviewer-B (Tier 2) + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) |
   | 3 | Anchor Reviewer + Reviewer-A (Tier 1) + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) | Reviewer-A (Tier 1) + Reviewer-B (Tier 2) + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) |
   | 4 (default with anchor) | Anchor Reviewer + Reviewer-A (Tier 1) + Reviewer-B (Tier 2) + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) | Reviewer-A (Tier 1) + Reviewer-B (Tier 2) + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) + Reviewer-D (Tier 1/Tier 2 variant) |
   | 5 | Anchor Reviewer + Reviewer-A (Tier 1) + Reviewer-B (Tier 2) + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) + Reviewer-D (Tier 1/Tier 2 variant) | Reviewer-A (Tier 1) + Reviewer-B (Tier 2) + Reviewer-C (Tier 3) + Reviewer-D (Tier 1/Tier 2 variant) + Reviewer-E (Tier 2/Tier 3 variant) |

   Record a declared fallback for the Anchor Reviewer whenever the anchor route is
   configured but unavailable.
4. Apply anchor and alternate model provider assignments:
   * Read `openai`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, and
     `high` (or `anchor_provider`,
     `anchor_family`, and `anchor_reasoning_effort` input overrides). If provider
     and family are non-empty and dispatchable, launch the Anchor Reviewer as a
     separate slot, pass the reasoning effort when non-empty, and identify it
     separately in the report.
   * Read `` and `` (or `alt_provider`
     / `alt_family` input overrides).
   * If both alternate values are non-empty: replace one non-anchor reviewer slot
     with the alternate provider. Replace Reviewer-B (Tier 2 slot) by default to
     maximize diversity while preserving Anchor, Tier 1, and Tier 3 coverage.
   * Log the model route assignment table (see below), including declared fallback
     if the Anchor Reviewer or alternate provider is unavailable.
5. Confirm with the operator if the review is interactive mode.

#### Model Route Assignment Table

| Reviewer | Default Route | Default Model | With Alternate Provider |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anchor Reviewer | Anchor review route | `gpt-5.6-sol` via `openai` with `high` when non-empty | unchanged; if unavailable, declared fallback |
| Reviewer-A | Tier 1 (fast/cheap) | `gpt-5.4-mini` | unchanged |
| Reviewer-B | Tier 2 (standard) | `claude-sonnet-5` | `` via `` |
| Reviewer-C | Tier 3 (frontier) | `claude-opus-5` | unchanged |
| Reviewer-D | Tier 1 or Tier 2 variant | different from A/B/C | unchanged |
| Reviewer-E (5 reviewers without anchor) | Tier 2 or Tier 3 variant | different from A/B/C/D | unchanged |

When `openai` or `gpt-5.6-sol` is empty or the
route cannot be dispatched, all standard reviewer slots still use tier routing and
the report records the Anchor Reviewer declared fallback. When
`` is non-empty, Reviewer-B is routed to the alternate
provider. This ensures reviewer diversity is not limited to a single provider's
model family while keeping the Anchor Reviewer separate.

### Phase 2: Parallel Dispatch

Launch all reviewer agents **simultaneously** as parallel subagents. Each receives:

* The same file list or diff
* The same ruleset
* Its assigned model tier or Anchor Reviewer route instruction (prepend to the reviewer's system prompt:
  "You are operating as the Anchor Reviewer or Tier N reviewer. Use concise, precise findings only.")
* Instruction to return **structured JSON findings only** — no prose summaries

Each reviewer produces a JSON array of findings:

```json
[
  {
    "severity": "CRITICAL|MAJOR|MINOR",
    "rule": "Rule number and name",
    "file": "path/to/file",
    "line": 42,
    "issue": "Precise description of what is wrong",
    "fix": "What the correct value or behavior should be"
  }
]
```

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all reviewer agents have returned results.

### Phase 3: Aggregate and Classify

Collect all finding arrays. For each unique finding (keyed by `file` + `line` + `rule`):

1. Count how many reviewers flagged it (using fuzzy match on `file` + `line` ± 2 + same `rule`).
2. Assign confidence tier and report section so every agreement count from 1 to
   `reviewers` is classified:
   * **HIGH / Consensus section**: Flagged by all `reviewers` agents.
   * **MEDIUM / Majority section**: Flagged by a strict majority (> reviewers / 2).
   * **MEDIUM / Plurality section**: Flagged by more than one reviewer but not a
     strict majority (for example, 2 of 4 reviewers).
   * **LOW / Unique section**: Flagged by exactly one reviewer.
3. For severity conflicts between reviewers, take the most conservative (highest severity).

### Phase 4: Order and Score

Compute a priority score for each finding:

```
priority = confidence_weight × severity_weight
confidence_weight: HIGH=3, MEDIUM=2, LOW=1
severity_weight: CRITICAL=4, MAJOR=3, MINOR=2
```

Sort all findings descending by priority score. Within the same score, order by
file path for deterministic output.

### Phase 5: Route to Action Classes

| Finding | Action Class |
|---|---|
| HIGH confidence + CRITICAL severity | `safe_auto` (if deterministic fix exists) or `manual` |
| HIGH confidence + MAJOR severity | `gated_auto` or `manual` |
| MEDIUM confidence + CRITICAL/MAJOR (majority or plurality) | `gated_auto` — confirm before applying |
| LOW confidence + CRITICAL | `gated_auto` — unusual enough to flag despite single source |
| Any + MINOR | `advisory` |

### Phase 6: Produce Output

Assemble the output report with all five finding/remediation sections (consensus,
majority, plurality, unique, remediation plan). For each P0 and P1 finding, produce
a backlog work item entry:

```yaml
type: bug
title: "{rule}: {brief description}"
description: "{issue}"
file: "{file}"
line: {line}
severity: "{severity}"
confidence: "{HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}"
fix: "{fix}"
linked_review: "{output_file_path}"
```

Write the output report to `docs/closure/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-adversarial-review.md`.
If in interactive mode, present the consensus findings and remediation plan to the
operator for confirmation before creating any backlog items.

If `post_remediation_review` is `true` (the default), apply all `safe_auto` fixes
from the remediation plan and proceed to Phase 7.

### Phase 7: Post-Remediation Re-Review

After `safe_auto` fixes are applied in Phase 6, re-dispatch the same reviewer pool
over the fixed files to verify no new issues were introduced. This phase prevents
a fix in one location from inadvertently breaking a related invariant.

**Recursion cap**: Maximum 2 re-review cycles (Phase 7 executes at most twice per
invocation). Track the cycle count. When the cap is reached, note any remaining
findings in the output report and halt the re-review loop — do not continue.

**Re-review protocol**:

1. Identify files modified by `safe_auto` fixes in the previous cycle.
2. Re-dispatch all reviewer agents over those files only (not the full original scope).
3. Aggregate and classify new findings per Phases 3–5.
4. If new HIGH-confidence findings are introduced: add them to the remediation plan,
   apply any new `safe_auto` entries, and increment the cycle counter.
5. If the cycle counter reaches 2 and findings remain: record them as
   `post_remediation_residual` in the output report. Do not apply further fixes.
6. If no new findings: mark the post-remediation phase clean and finish.

**Cycle tracking** in the output report:

```yaml
post_remediation:
  cycles_run: {0|1|2}
  cap_reached: {true|false}
  residual_findings: {count}
  status: "clean|residual_capped|skipped"
```

## Subagent Depth

Maximum 2 hops. This agent dispatches review skill instances (hop 1), which may invoke
review persona subagents (hop 2). The consensus-assembly phase and post-remediation
re-review loop run in this agent — no further delegation.

## Quality Criteria

* All reviewer instances must complete before Phase 3 begins — partial consensus is
  not valid
* The output must include all three confidence tiers (never drop LOW findings)
* Every P0 finding, regardless of confidence, must appear in the remediation plan
* The output file must be written even if all findings are advisory
* If fewer than 2 reviewer instances return results, halt and report the failure
* Post-remediation re-review runs when `post_remediation_review` is `true` and
  `safe_auto` fixes were applied; it is skipped when no fixes were made
* The recursion cap of 2 cycles is enforced — the agent MUST NOT recurse more than
  twice regardless of remaining findings
* When `openai` is set, the Anchor Reviewer must use that
  provider's model family unless the provider is unavailable; if unavailable, log
  the declared fallback separately and continue only when consensus minimums hold
* When `` is set, at least one non-anchor reviewer must use the alternate
  provider; failure to route when the provider and family are both configured and
  reachable is a configuration error; if the provider is unreachable at runtime,
  fall back to the Tier 2 standard model, log the fallback, and continue
